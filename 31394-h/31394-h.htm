<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>"'I should like to show you a series of eight
articles, Sir, that have appeared in the Eatanswill
Gazette. I think I may venture to say that you
would not be long in establishing your opinions on a
firm and solid basis, Sir.'</p>

<p>"'I dare say I should turn very blue long before I
got to the end of them,' responded Bob.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pott looked dubiously at Bob Sawyer for
some seconds, and turning to Mr. Pickwick said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'You have seen the literary articles which have
appeared at intervals in the Eatanswill Gazette in the
course of the last three months, and which have excited
such general&mdash;I may say such universal&mdash;attention
and admiration?'</p>

<p>"'Why,' replied Mr. Pickwick, slightly embarrassed
by the question, 'the fact is, I have been so much
engaged in other ways, that I really have not had an
opportunity of perusing them.'</p>

<p>"'You should do so, Sir,' said Pott with a severe
countenance.</p>

<p>"'I will,' said Mr. Pickwick.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>"'They appeared in the form of a copious review of
a work on Chinese metaphysics, Sir,' said Pott.</p>

<p>"'Oh,' observed Mr. Pickwick&mdash;'from your pen I
hope?'</p>

<p>"'From the pen of my critic, Sir,' rejoined Pott
with dignity.</p>

<p>"'An abstruse subject I should conceive,' said Mr.
Pickwick.</p>

<p>"'Very, Sir,' responded Pott, looking intensely
sage. 'He <i>crammed</i> for it, to use a technical but expressive
term; he read up for the subject, at my
desire, in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>.'</p>

<p>"'Indeed!' said Mr. Pickwick; 'I was not aware
that that valuable work contained any information
respecting Chinese metaphysics.'</p>

<p>"'He read, Sir,' rejoined Mr. Pott, laying his hand
on Mr. Pickwick's knee, and looking round with a
smile of intellectual superiority, 'he read for metaphysics
under the letter M, and for China under the
letter C; and combined his information, Sir!'</p>

<p>"Mr. Pott's features assumed so much additional
grandeur at the recollection of the power and research
displayed in the learned effusions in question, that
some minutes elapsed before Mr. Pickwick felt emboldened
to renew the conversation."</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>The above perennial extract from the immortal
<i>Pickwick Papers</i> suggests to some extent the nature
of the contents of this Volume. It is the record of
a pilgrimage made by two enthusiastic Dickensians
during the late summer of 1888, together with "combined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
information,"&mdash;not indeed "crammed" from the
ninth edition just completed of the valuable work
above referred to, but gathered mostly from original
sources,&mdash;respecting the places visited, the characters
alluded to in some of the novels, personal
reminiscences of their Author, appropriate passages
from his works (for which acknowledgments are due
to Messrs. Chapman and Hall), and some little
mention of the thoughts developed by the associations
of "Dickens-Land."</p>

<p>Although the pilgrimage only extended to a week,
and every spot referred to (save one) was actually visited
during that time, it is but right to state that on three
subsequent occasions the author has gone over the
greater part of the same ground&mdash;once in the early
winter, when the blue clematis and the aster had given
place to the yellow jasmine and the chrysanthemum;
once in the early spring, when those had been succeeded
by the almond-blossom and the crocus; and
again in the following year, when the beautiful county
of Kent was rehabilitated in summer clothing, thus
enabling him to verify observations, to correct possible
errors arising from first impressions, and to gain new
experiences.</p>

<p>As our head-quarters were at Rochester, and most
of the city and other parts were taken at odd times, it
has not been found practicable to preserve in consecutive
chapters a perfect sequence of the records
of each day's tramp, although they appear in fairly
chronological order throughout the work. "A preliminary
tramp in London" will possibly be dull to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
those familiar with the great Metropolis, but it may be
useful to foreign tramps in "Dickens-Land."</p>

<p>Availing myself of the privilege adopted by most
travellers at home and abroad, I have made occasional
references to the weather. This is perhaps excusable
when it is remembered that the year 1888 was a very
remarkable one in that respect, so much so indeed,
that the writer of a leading article in <i>The Times</i> of
January 18th, 1889, in commenting on Mr. G. J.
Symons' report of the British rainfall of the previous
year, remarked that "seldom within living memory
had there been a twelve-month with more unpleasantness
in it and less of genial sunshine." We
were specially favoured, however, in getting more
"sunshine" than "unpleasantness," thus adding to the
enjoyment of our never-to-be-forgotten tramp.</p>

<p>Upwards of three years have elapsed since this book
was commenced, and the limited holiday leisure of a
hard-working official life has necessarily prevented its
completion for such a lengthened period, that it has
come to be pleasantly referred to by my many
Dickensian friends as the "Dictionary," in allusion to
the important work of that nature contemplated by
Dr. Strong, respecting which (says David Copperfield)
"Adams, our head-boy, who had a turn for mathematics,
had made a calculation, I was informed, of the
time this Dictionary would take in completing, on the
Doctor's plan, and at the Doctor's rate of going. He
considered that it might be done in one thousand six
hundred and forty-nine years, counting from the
Doctor's last, or sixty-second, birthday."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p>My hearty and sincere acknowledgments are due
to the publishers, Messrs. Chapman and Hall, not
only for the very handsome manner in which they
have allowed my book to be got up as regards
print, paper, and execution (to follow the model of
their Victoria Edition of <i>Pickwick</i> is indeed an
honour to me), but especially for their great liberality
in the matter of the Illustrations, which number more
than a hundred. These were selected in conference
by Mr. Fred Chapman, Mr. Kitton, and myself, and
include about fifty original drawings by Mr. Kitton,
from sketches specially made by him for this work.
Of the remainder, six are from Forster's <i>Life of
Dickens</i>, fifteen from Langton's <i>Childhood and Youth
of Charles Dickens</i>, seven from <i>Charles Dickens by
Pen and Pencil</i>, ten from the Jubilee Edition of
<i>Pickwick</i>, and five from Rimmer's <i>About England
with Dickens</i>. A few interesting fac-similes of handwriting,
etc., have also been introduced. Surely such
an eclectic series of Dickens Illustrations has never
before been presented in one volume.</p>

<p>To Messrs. Chapman and Hall, Mr. Robert
Langton, F.R.H.S., Messrs. Frank T. Sabin and
John F. Dexter, Messrs. Macmillan and Co., and
Messrs. Chatto and Windus (the proprietors of the
above-mentioned works), the author's acknowledgments
are also due, and are hereby tendered. Mr.
Stephen T. Aveling has kindly supplied an illustration
of Restoration House as it appeared in Dickens's time,
and Mr. William Ball, J.P., generously commissioned
a local artist to make a sketch of the Marshes, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
forms the frontispiece to the book, and gives a good
idea of the "long stretches of flat lands" on the Kent
and Essex coasts.</p>

<p>To those friends whom we then met for the first
time, and from whom we subsequently received help,
the author's most cordial acknowledgments are due,
and are also tendered, for kind information and
assistance. They are a goodly number, and include
Mr. A. A. Arnold, Mr. Stephen T. Aveling, Mr.
William Ball, J.P., Mr. James Baird, Mr. Charles Bird,
F.G.S., Major and Mrs. Budden, Mr. W. J. Budden,
Mr. R. L. Cobb, Mr. J. Couchman, The Misses
Drage, Mrs. Easedown, Mr. Franklin Homan, Mr.
James Hulkes, J.P., and Mrs. Hulkes, Mr. Apsley
Kennette, Mrs. Latter, Mr. J. Lawrence, Mr. C. D.
Levy, Mr. B. Lillie, Mr. J. E. Littlewood, Mr. J. N.
Malleson, Rev. J. J. Marsham, M.A., Mrs. Masters,
Mr. Miles, Mr. W. Millen, Mr. Geo. Payne, F.S.A.,
Mr. William Pearce, Mr. George Robinson, Mr. T.
B. Rosseter, F.R.M.S., Dr. Sheppard, Mr. Henry
Smetham, Dr. Steele, M.R.C.S., Mr. William Syms,
Mrs. Taylor, Miss Taylor, Mr. W. S. Trood, Major
Trousdell, Rev. Robert Whiston, M.A., Mr. W. T.
Wildish, Mr. Humphrey Wood, Mr. C. K. Worsfold,
and Mrs. Henry Wright. The late Mr. Roach Smith,
F.S.A., took much interest in my work and gave valuable
assistance. Mr. Luke Fildes, R.A., and Mrs. Lynn
Linton generously contributed very interesting information.
The Right Honourable the Earl of Darnley,
Mr. Henry Fielding Dickens, Mr. W. P. Frith, R.A.,
and Lady Head, also kindly answered enquiries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Hogarth has at my request very kindly consented
to the publication of the original letters of the
Novelist&mdash;about a dozen&mdash;now printed for the first
time.</p>

<p>My sincere thanks are due to Mr. E. W. Badger,
F.R.H.S., the friend of many years, for valuable help.</p>

<p>To my old friend and fellow-tramp, Mr. F. G. Kitton,
with whose memory this delightful excursion will ever
be pleasantly connected, my warmest thanks are due
for reading proofs and for much kind help in many
ways. "He wos werry good to me, he wos." As Pip
wrote to another "Jo," "<span class="smcap">woT larX</span>" we did have.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, my cordial thanks are due to
Mr. Charles Dickens for much kind information and
valuable criticism.</p>

<p>So long as readers continue to be, so long
will our great English trilogy of cognate authors,
Shakespeare, Scott, and Dickens, continue to be read.
Indeed as regards Dickens, a writer in <i>Blackwood</i>,
June, 1871 (and <i>Blackwood</i> was not always a sympathetic
critic), said:&mdash;"We may apply to him, without
doubt, the surest test to which the maker can be
subject: were all his books swept by some intellectual
catastrophe out of the world, there would still exist
in the world some score at least of people, with all
whose ways and sayings we are more intimately acquainted
than with those of our brothers and sisters,
who would owe to him their being. While we live
Sam Weller and Dick Swiveller, Mr. Pecksniff and
Mrs. Gamp, the Micawbers and the Squeerses, can
never die.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They are more real than we are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
ourselves, and will outlive and outlast us, as they
have outlived their creator. This is the one proof of
genius which no critic, not the most carping or
dissatisfied, can gainsay."</p>

<p>So long also, the author ventures to think,
will pilgrimages continue to be made to the shrines
of Stratford-on-Avon, Abbotsford, and Gad's Hill
Place, and to their vicinities. The modest aim of
this Volume is, that it may add a humble unit
in helping to keep <i>his</i> memory green, and that it
may be a useful and acceptable companion to pilgrims,
not only of our own country, but also from that
still "Greater Britain," where "All the Year <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'round'">Round</ins>"
the name of Charles Dickens is almost a dearer
"Household Word" than it is with us.</p>

<h2>A WEEK'S TRAMP</h2>

<h3>IN</h3>

<h2>DICKENS-LAND.</h2>



<hr style="width: 25%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY.</h3>

<div class="hang2">"So wishing you well in the way you go, we now conclude with the
observation, that perhaps you'll go it."&mdash;<i>Our Mutual Friend.</i></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Among</span> the many interesting books that have been published
relating to Charles Dickens since his death, more than
twenty years ago (it seems but yesterday to some of his
admirers), there are at least half a dozen that describe the
"country" peopled by the deathless characters created by his
genius.</div>

<p>Probably the pioneer in this class of literature was that
comprehensive work, <i>Dickens's London, or London in the
Works of Charles Dickens</i>, by my friend, that thorough
Dickensian, Mr. T. Edgar Pemberton, 1876; this was followed
by a very readable volume, <i>In Kent with Charles Dickens</i>, by
Thomas Frost, 1880; then came a dainty tome from Boston,
U.S.A., entitled, <i>A Pickwickian Pilgrimage</i>, by John R. G.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Hassard, 1881. Afterwards appeared <i>The Childhood and
Youth of Charles Dickens</i>, by Robert Langton, 1883, beautifully
illustrated by the late William Hull of Manchester, the
author, and others&mdash;a work developed from the <i>brochure</i> by
the same author, <i>Charles Dickens and Rochester</i>, 1880, which
has passed through five editions. Next to Forster's <i>Life
of Dickens</i>, Mr. Robert Langton's larger work undoubtedly
ranks&mdash;especially from the richness of the illustrations&mdash;as a
very valuable original contribution to the biography of the
great novelist. Another handsome volume, containing the
illustrations to a series of papers in <i>Scribner's Monthly</i>&mdash;written
by B. E. Martin&mdash;entitled <i>About England with
Dickens</i>, came from the pen of Mr. Alfred Rimmer, 1883,
and included additional illustrations drawn by the author,
C. A. Vanderhoof, and others. Yet another little <i>brochure</i>
recently appeared, called <i>London Rambles en zigzag with
Charles Dickens</i>, by Robert Allbut, 1886. Lastly, there
was published in the Christmas Number of <i>Scribner's
Magazine</i>, 1887, an article, "In Dickens-Land," by Edward
Percy Whipple, in which this veteran and appreciative critic
of the eminent English writer's works points out that, "In
addition to the practical life that men and women lead,
constantly vexed as it is by obstructive facts, there is an
interior life which they <i>imagine</i>, in which facts smoothly give
way to sentiments, ideas, and aspirations. Dickens has, in
short, discovered and colonized one of the waste districts of
'Imagination,' which we may call 'Dickens-Land,' or
'Dickens-Ville,' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. better known than such geographical
countries as Canada and Australia, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and confirming us
in the belief of the <i>reality</i> of a population which has no <i>actual</i>
existence."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>It must not be assumed that the above list exhausts the
literature on the subject of "Dickens-Land," many references
to which are made in such high-class works as Augustus J. C.
Hare's <i>Walks in London</i>, and Lawrence Hutton's <i>Literary
Landmarks of London</i>.</p>

<p>Since the above was written, a very interesting and prettily
illustrated article has appeared in the <i>English Illustrated
Magazine</i> for October, 1888, entitled "Charles Dickens and
Southwark," by Mr. J. Ashby-Sterry, who is second to none
as an enthusiastic admirer and loyal student of Dickens.
There is also a paper in <i>Longman's Magazine</i> for the same
month, by the delightful essayist A. K. H. B., called "That
Longest Day," in which there are several allusions to Dickens
and "Dickens-Land." It, however, lacks the freshness of his
earlier writings. Surely he must have lost his old love for
Dickens, or things must have gone wrong at the Ecclesiastical
Conference which took place at Gravesend on "That Longest
Day." Altogether it is pitched in a minor key.</p>

<p>None of these contributions (with the exception of Mr.
Langton's book), interesting as they are, and indispensable
to the collector, attempt in any way to give personal
reminiscences of Charles Dickens from friends or others,
nor do they in any way help to throw light on his everyday
life at home, beyond what was known before.</p>

<p>The circumstances narrated in this work do not concern the
imaginary "Dickens-Land" of Mr. Whipple, but refer to the
actual country in which the imaginary characters played their
parts, and to that still more interesting actual country in which
Dickens lived long and loved most&mdash;the county of Kent.</p>

<p>On Friday, 24th August, 1888, two friends met in London&mdash;one
of them, the writer of these lines, a Dickens collector of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
some years' experience; the other, Mr. F. G. Kitton, author
of that sumptuous work, <i>Charles Dickens by Pen and
Pencil;</i> both ardent admirers of "the inimitable 'Boz,'" and
lovers of nature and art.</p>

<p>We were a sort of self-constituted roving commission, to
carry into effect a long-projected intention to make a week's
tramp in "Dickens-Land," for purposes of health and
recreation; to visit Gad's Hill, Rochester, Chatham, and
neighbouring classical ground; to go over and verify some of
the most important localities rendered famous in the novels;
to identify, if possible, doubtful spots; and to glean, under
whatever circumstances naturally developed in the progress
of our tramp, additions in any form to the many interesting
memorials already published, and still ever growing,
relating to the renowned novelist. The idea of recording our
reminiscences was not a primary consideration. It grew out
of our experiences, generating a desire for others to become
acquainted with the results of our enjoyable peregrinations;
and the labour therein involved has been somewhat of the
kind described by Lewis Morris:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"For this of old is sure,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That change of toil is toil's sufficient cure."</span><br />
</div>

<p>We mixed with representatives of the classes of domestics,
labourers, artizans, traders, professional men, and scientists.
Many of those whom we met were advanced in years,&mdash;several
were octogenarians,&mdash;and there is no doubt that we have been
the means of placing on record here and there an interesting
item from the past generation (mostly told in the exact words
of the narrators) that might otherwise have perished. This is
a special feature of this work, which makes it different from all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the preceding. In every instance we were received with
very great kindness, courtesy, and attention. The replies to
our questions were frank and generous, and in several cases
permission was accorded us to make copies of original
documents not hitherto made public.</p>

<p>Considering that almost every inch of ground connected
with Dickens has been so thoroughly explored, we were, on
the whole, quite satisfied with our excursion: "the results
were equal to the appliances."</p>

<p>By a coincidence, the month which we selected (August)
was Dickens's favourite month, if we may judge from the
opening sentences of the sixteenth chapter of <i>Pickwick:</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is no month in the whole year, in which nature wears a
more beautiful appearance than in the month of August. Spring has
many beauties, and May is a fresh and blooming month, but the
charms of this time of year are enhanced by their contrast with the
winter season. August has no such advantage. It comes when we
remember nothing but clear skies, green fields, and sweet-smelling
flowers&mdash;when the recollection of snow, and ice, and bleak winds,
has faded from our minds as completely as they have disappeared
from the earth,&mdash;and yet what a pleasant time it is. Orchards and
cornfields ring with the hum of labour; trees bend beneath the thick
clusters of rich fruit which bow their branches to the ground; and
the corn, piled in graceful sheaves, or waving in every light breath
that sweeps above it, as if it wooed the sickle, tinges the landscape
with a golden hue. A mellow softness appears to hang over the
whole earth; the influence of the season seems to extend itself to
the very wagon, whose slow motion across the well-reaped field, is
perceptible only to the eye, but strikes with no harsh sound upon
the ear."</p></div>

<p>By another coincidence, the day which we selected to
commence our tramp was Friday&mdash;the day upon which most
of the important incidents of Dickens's life happened, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
appears from frequent references in Forster's <i>Life</i> to the
subject.</p>

<p>Provided with a selection of books inseparably connected
with the subject of our tour, including, of course, copies of
<i>Pickwick</i>, <i>Great Expectations</i>, <i>Edwin Drood</i>, <i>The Uncommercial
Traveller</i>, Bevan's <i>Tourist's Guide to Kent</i>, one or two local
Handbooks, one of Bacon's useful cycling maps, with a sketch
map of the geology of the district (which greatly helped us
to understand many of its picturesque effects, and was kindly
furnished by Professor Lapworth, LL.D., F.R.S., of the
Mason College, Birmingham), and with a pocket aneroid
barometer, which every traveller should possess himself with
if he wishes to make convenient arrangements as regards
weather, we make a preliminary tramp in London.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>A PRELIMINARY TRAMP IN LONDON.</h3>

<div class="hang2">"We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable
to doubt our having and our being the best of everything: otherwise,
while I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I might
have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly, crooked,
narrow, and dirty."&mdash;<i>Great Expectations.</i></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Some</span> sixty or seventy years must have elapsed since Dickens
(through the mouthpiece of Pip, as above) recorded his first
impressions of London; and although he lived in it many
years, and in after life he loved to study its people in every
stratum of society and every phase of their existence, it
seems doubtful, apart from these studies, whether he ever really
liked London itself, for in the <i>Uncommercial Traveller</i>, on
"The Boiled Beef of New England," in describing London as
it existed subsequently, he contrasts it unfavourably in some
respects, not only with such continental cities as Paris,
Bordeaux, Frankfort, Milan, Geneva, and Rome, but also
with such British cities as Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Exeter, and
Liverpool, with such American cities as New York, Boston,
and Philadelphia, and with "a bright little town like Bury
St. Edmunds." Nevertheless, it is indubitable that his writings,
beyond those of any other author, have done wonders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to popularize our knowledge of London,&mdash;more particularly
the London of the latter half of the last and the first half of
the present century,&mdash;and that those writings have given it a
hold on our affections which it might not otherwise have
acquired. In almost all his works we are introduced to a fresh
spot in the Metropolis, perhaps previously known to us, but to
which the fidelity of his descriptions and the reality of the
characters peopling it, certainly give a historical value never
before understood or appreciated. In <i>The Life of Charles
Dickens</i>, written by his devoted friend, John Forster, may be
found a corroboration of this view:&mdash;</div>

<p>"There seemed," says this biographer, "to be not much to
add to our knowledge of London until his books came upon
us, but each in this respect outstripped the other in its
marvels. In <i>Nickleby</i>, the old city reappears under every
aspect; and whether warmth and light are playing over what
is good and cheerful in it, or the veil is uplifted from its darker
scenes, it is at all times our privilege to see and feel it as it
absolutely is. Its interior hidden life becomes familiar as its
commonest outward forms, and we discover that we hardly
knew anything of the places we supposed that we knew the
best."</p>

<p>What Scott did for Edinburgh and the Trossachs, Dickens
did for London and the county of Kent. His fascination for
the London streets has been dwelt on by many an author.
Mr. Frank T. Marzials says in his interesting <i>Life of Charles
Dickens:</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>"London remained the walking-ground of his heart. As
he liked best to walk in London, so he liked best to walk at
night. The darkness of the great city had a strange fascination
for him. He never grew tired of it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Sala records that he had been encountered "in the
oddest places and in the most inclement weather: in Ratcliff
Highway, on Haverstock Hill, on Camberwell Green, in
Gray's Inn Lane, in the Wandsworth Road, at Hammersmith
Broadway, in Norton Folgate, and at Kensal New Town. A
hansom whirled you by the 'Bell and Horns' at Brompton,
and there was Charles Dickens striding as with seven-leagued
boots, seemingly in the direction of North End, Fulham.
The Metropolitan Railway disgorged you at Lisson Grove,
and you met Charles Dickens plodding sturdily towards the
'Yorkshire Stingo.' He was to be met rapidly skirting the
grim brick wall of the prison in Coldbath Fields, or trudging
along the Seven Sisters' Road at Holloway, or bearing under
a steady press of sail through Highgate Archway, or pursuing
the even tenor of his way up the Vauxhall Bridge Road."</p>

<p>That his feelings were intensely sympathetic with all classes
of humanity there is amply evidenced in the following lines,
written so far back as 1841, which Master Humphrey, "from
his clock side in the chimney corner," speaks in the last page
before the opening of <i>Barnaby Rudge:</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Heart of London, there is a moral in thy every stroke! as I look
on at thy indomitable working, which neither death, nor press of life,
nor grief, nor gladness out of doors will influence one jot, I seem to
hear a voice within thee which sinks into my heart, bidding me, as I
elbow my way among the crowd, have some thought for the meanest
wretch that passes, and, being a man, to turn away with scorn and
pride from none that bear the human shape."</p></div>

<p>On a sultry day, such as this of Friday, the 24th August,
1888, with the thermometer at nearly 80 degrees in the shade,
one needs some enthusiasm to undertake a tramp for a few
hours over the hot and dusty streets of London, that we may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
glance at a few of the memorable spots that we have visited
over and over again before. This preliminary tramp is therefore
necessarily limited to visiting the houses where Dickens
lived, from the year 1836 until he finally left it in 1860, on
disposing of Tavistock House, and took up his residence at
Gad's Hill Place. In our way we shall take a few of the
places rendered famous in the novels, but it would require a
"knowledge of London" as "extensive and peculiar" as that
of Mr. Weller, and would occupy a week at least, to exhaust
the interest of all these associations.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 558px;">
<img src="images/i_033.png" width="558" height="620" alt="The Golden Cross." title="" />
</div>

<p>Our temporary quarters are at our favourite "Morley's," in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Trafalgar Square, one of those old-fashioned, comfortable
hotels of the last generation, where the guest is still known
as "Mr. H.," and not as "Number 497." And what is very
relevant to our present purpose, Morley's revives associations
of the hotels, or "Inns," as they were more generally
called in Charles Dickens's early days. Strolling from Morley's
eastward along the Strand, to which busy thoroughfare there
are numerous references in the works of Dickens, we pass on
our left the Golden Cross Hotel, a great coaching-house half
a century ago, from whence the Pickwickians and Mr. Jingle
started, on the 13th of May, 1827, by the "Commodore"
coach for Rochester. "The low archway," against which Mr.
Jingle thus prudently cautioned the passengers,&mdash;"Heads!
Heads! Take care of your heads!" with the addition of a
very tragic reference to the head of a family, was removed
in 1851, and the hotel has the same appearance now that it
presented after that alteration. The house was a favourite
with David Copperfield, who stayed there with his friend
Steerforth on his arrival "outside the Canterbury coach;"
and it was in one of the public rooms here, approached by
"a side entrance to the stable-yard," that the affecting
interview took place with his humble friend Mr. Peggotty,
as touchingly recorded in the fortieth chapter of <i>David
Copperfield</i>. The two famous "pudding shops" in the Strand,
so minutely described in connection with David's early days,
have of course long been removed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"One was in a court close to St. Martin's Church&mdash;at the back
of the Church,&mdash;which is now removed altogether. The pudding at
that shop was made of currants, and was rather a special pudding,
but was dear, two pennyworth not being larger than a pennyworth
of more ordinary pudding. A good shop for the latter was in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Strand,&mdash;somewhere in that part which has been rebuilt since. It
was a stout pale pudding, heavy and flabby, and with great flat
raisins in it, stuck in whole at wide distances apart. It came up
hot at about my time every day, and many a day did I dine off it."</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 423px;">
<img src="images/i_035.png" width="423" height="567" alt="Young Dickens at the Blacking Warehouse." title="" />
<span class="caption">Young Dickens at the Blacking Warehouse.</span>
</div>

<p>Nearly opposite the Golden Cross Hotel is Craven Street,
where (says Mr. Allbut), at No. 39, Mr. Brownlow in <i>Oliver
Twist</i> resided after removing from Pentonville, and where
the villain Monks was confronted, and made a full confession
of his guilt.</p>

<p>"Ruminating on the strange mutability of human affairs,"
after the manner of Mr. Pickwick, we call to mind, on the
same side of the way, Hungerford Stairs, Market, and Bridge,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
all well remembered in the days of our youth, but now
swept away to make room for the commodious railway
terminus at Charing Cross. Here poor David Copperfield
"served as a labouring hind," and acquired his grim experience
with poverty in Murdstone and Grinby's (<i>alias</i> Lamert's)
Blacking Warehouse. Hungerford Suspension Bridge many
years ago was removed to Clifton, and we never pass by it
on the Great Western line without recalling recollections of
poor David's sorrows.</p>

<p>Next in order comes Buckingham Street, at the end house
of which, on the east side (No. 15), lived Mrs. Crupp, who let
apartments to David Copperfield in happier days. Here he
had his "first dissipation," and entertained Steerforth and
his two friends, Mrs. Crupp imposing on him frightfully as
regards the dinner; "the handy young man" and the
"young gal" being equally troublesome as regards the
waiting. The description of "my set of chambers" in
<i>David Copperfield</i> seems to point to the possibility of Dickens
having resided here, but there is no evidence to prove it.
At Osborn's Hotel, now the Adelphi, in John Street, Mr.
Wardle and his daughter Emily stayed on their visit to
London, after Mr. Pickwick was released from the Fleet
Prison.</p>

<p>Durham Street, a little further to the right, leads to the
"dark arches," which had attractions for David Copperfield,
who "was fond of wandering about the Adelphi, because it
was a mysterious place with those dark arches." He says:&mdash;"I
see myself emerging one evening from out of these arches,
on a little public-house, close to the river, with a space before
it, where some coal-heavers were dancing." Nearly opposite
is the Adelphi Theatre, notable as having been the stage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
whereon most of the dramas founded on Dickens's works were
first produced, from <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> in 1838, in which
Mrs. Keeley, John Webster, and O. Smith took part, down
to 1867, when <i>No Thoroughfare</i> was performed, "the only
story," says Mr. Forster, "Dickens himself ever helped to
dramatize," and which was rendered with such fine effect
by Fechter, Benjamin Webster, Mrs. Alfred Mellon, and
other important actors. He certainly assisted in Madame
Celeste's production of <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, even if he had
no actual part in the writing of the piece.</p>

<p>Mr. Allbut thinks that the residence of Miss La Creevy, the
good-natured miniature painter (whose prototype was Miss
Barrow, Dickens's aunt on his mother's side) in <i>Nicholas
Nickleby</i>, was probably at No. 111, Strand. It was "a private
door about half-way down that crowded thoroughfare."</p>

<p>We proceed onwards, passing Wellington Street North,
where at No. 16, the office of the famous <i>Household Words</i>
formerly stood; <i>All the Year Round</i>, its successor, conducted
by Mr. Charles Dickens, the novelist's eldest son, now being
at No. 26 in the same street.</p>

<p>A little further on, on the same side of the way, and almost
facing Somerset House, at No. 332, was the office of the once
celebrated <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, on the staff of which Dickens
in early life worked as a reporter. The <i>Chronicle</i> was a great
power in its day, when Mr. John Black ("Dear old Black!"
Dickens calls him, "my first hearty out-and-out appreciator,
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with never-forgotten compliments .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. coming in the
broadest of Scotch from the broadest of hearts I ever knew,")
was editor, and Mr. J. Campbell, afterwards Lord Chief-Justice
Campbell, its chief literary critic. The <i>Chronicle</i> died in 1862.</p>

<p>The west corner of Arundel Street (No. 186, Strand, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
now stand the extensive premises of Messrs. W. H. Smith
and Son) was formerly the office of Messrs. Chapman and
Hall, the publishers of almost all the original works of Charles
Dickens. After 1850 the firm removed to 193, Piccadilly,
their present house being at 11, Henrietta Street, Covent
Garden. They own the copyright, and publish all Dickens's
works; and they estimate that two million copies of <i>Pickwick</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
have been sold in England alone, exclusive of the almost
innumerable popular editions, from one penny upwards,
published by other firms, the copyright of this work having
expired. The penny edition was sold by hundreds of
thousands in the streets of London some years ago.</p>

<p>This statement will probably be surprising to the remarkable
class of readers thus described by that staunch
admirer of Dickens, Mr. Andrew Lang, in "Phiz," one of his
charming <i>Lost Leaders</i>. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a singular and gloomy feature in the character of
young ladies and gentlemen of a particular type, that they
have ceased to care for Dickens, as they have ceased to
care for Scott. They say they cannot read Dickens. When
Mr. Pickwick's adventures are presented to the modern
maid, she behaves like the Cambridge freshman. 'Euclide
viso, cohorruit et evasit.' When he was shown Euclid he
evinced dismay, and sneaked off. Even so do most young
people act when they are expected to read <i>Nicholas
Nickleby</i> and <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>. They call these master-pieces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
'too gutterly gutter'; they cannot sympathize with
this honest humour and conscious pathos. Consequently the
innumerable references to Sam Weller, and Mrs. Gamp, and
Mr. Pecksniff, and Mr. Winkle, which fill our ephemeral
literature, are written for these persons in an unknown tongue.
The number of people who could take a good pass in Mr.
Calverley's <i>Pickwick</i> Examination Paper is said to be
diminishing. Pathetic questions are sometimes put. Are we
not too much cultivated? Can this fastidiousness be anything
but a casual passing phase of taste? Are all people
over thirty who cling to their Dickens and their Scott old
fogies? Are we wrong in preferring them to <i>Bootles' Baby</i>,
and <i>The Quick or the Dead</i>, and the novels of M. Paul
Bourget?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_039.png" width="500" height="370" alt="Fountain Court, Temple." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fountain Court, Temple.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>But this by the way. Turning down Essex Street, we
visit the Temple, celebrated in several of Dickens's novels&mdash;<i>Barnaby
Rudge</i>, <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, <i>Great Expectations</i>,
and <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>,&mdash;but in none more graphically
than in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>, in which is described the
fountain in Fountain Court, where Ruth Pinch goes to
meet her lover, "coming briskly up, with the best little laugh
upon her face that ever played in opposition to the fountain;
and beat it all to nothing." And when John Westlock
came at last, "merrily the fountain leaped and danced, and
merrily the smiling dimples twinkled and expanded more and
more, until they broke into a laugh against the basin's rim,
and vanished." As we saw the fountain on the bright August
morning of our tramp, the few shrubs, flowers, and ferns
planted round it gave it quite a rural effect, and we wished
long life to the solitary specimen of eucalyptus, whose
glaucous-green leaves and tender shoots seemed ill-fitted to
bear the nipping frosts of our variable climate.</p>

<p>Coming out of the Temple by Middle Temple Lane, we
pass on our left Child's Bank, the "Tellson's Bank" of <i>A Tale
of Two Cities</i>, "which was an old-fashioned place even in the
year 1780," but was replaced in 1878 by the handsome building
suitable to its imposing neighbours, the Law Courts.
Temple Bar, which adjoined the Old Bank, and was one of
the relics of Dickens's London, has passed away, having
since been re-erected on "Theobalds," near Waltham Cross.</p>

<p>"A walk down Fleet Street"&mdash;one of Dr. Johnson's
enjoyments&mdash;leads us to Whitefriars Street, on the east side
of which, at No. 67, is the office of <i>The Daily News</i>, edited by
Dickens from 21 Jany. to 9 Feby., 1846, and for which he
wrote the original prospectus, and subsequently, in a series of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
letters descriptive of his Italian travel, his delightful <i>Pictures
from Italy</i>. St. Dunstan's Church in Fleet Street is supposed
to have been that immortalized in <i>The Chimes</i>.</p>

<p>It was in this street many years before (in the year 1833,
when he was only twenty-one), as recorded in Forster's <i>Life</i>,
that Dickens describes himself as dropping his first literary
sketch, <i>Mrs. Joseph Porter over the Way</i>, "stealthily one
evening at twilight, with fear and trembling, into a dark
letter-box in a dark office up a dark court in Fleet Street;
and he has told his agitation when it appeared in all the
glory of print:&mdash;'On which occasion I walked down to
Westminster Hall, and turned into it for half an hour, because
my eyes were so dimmed with joy and pride, that they could
not bear the street, and were not fit to be seen there.'" The
"dark court" referred to was no doubt Johnson's Court, as
the printers of the <i>Monthly Magazine</i>, Messrs. Baylis and
Leighton, had their offices here. This contribution appeared
in the January number 1834 of this magazine, published by
Messrs. Cochrane and Macrone of 11 Waterloo Place.</p>

<p>Turning up Chancery Lane, also celebrated in many of
Charles Dickens's novels, we leave on our left Bell Yard,
where lodged the ruined suitor in Chancery, poor Gridley,
"the man from Shropshire" in <i>Bleak House</i>, but the yard has,
through part of it being required for the New Law Courts
and other modern improvements, almost lost its identity.</p>

<p>On our right is Old Serjeant's Inn, which leads into
Clifford's Inn, where the conference took place between
John Rokesmith and Mr. Boffin, when the former, to the
latter's amazement, said:&mdash;"If you would try me as your
Secretary." The place is thus referred to in the eighth
chapter of <i>Our Mutual Friend:</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Not very well knowing how to get rid of this applicant, and
feeling the more embarrassed because his manner and appearance
claimed a delicacy in which the worthy Mr. Boffin feared he himself
might be deficient, that gentleman glanced into the mouldy little
plantation or cat preserve, of Clifford's Inn, as it was that day, in
search of a suggestion. Sparrows were there, dry-rot and wet-rot
were there, but it was not otherwise a suggestive spot."</p></div>

<p>Symond's Inn, described as "a little, pale, wall-eyed, woebegone
inn, like a large dust-bin of two compartments and a
sifter,"&mdash;where Mr. Vholes had his chambers, and where Ada
Clare came to live after her marriage, there tending lovingly
the blighted life of the suitor in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, poor
Richard Carstone,&mdash;exists no more. It formerly stood on the
site of Nos. 25, 26, and 27, now handsome suites of offices.</p>

<p>Lincoln's Inn, a little higher up on the opposite side of the
way, claims our attention, in the Hall of which was formerly
the Lord High Chancellor's Court, wherein the wire-drawn
Chancery suit of Jarndyce and Jarndyce in <i>Bleak House</i>
dragged its course wearily along. The offices of Messrs.
Kenge and Carboy, of Old Square, Solicitors in the famous
suit, were visited by Esther Summerson, who says:&mdash;"We
passed into sudden quietude, under an old gallery, and drove
on through a silent square, until we came to an old nook
in a corner, where there was an entrance up a steep broad
flight of stairs like an entrance to a church." Mr. Serjeant
Snubbin, Mr. Pickwick's counsel in the notorious cause of
Bardell <i>v.</i> Pickwick, also had his chambers in this square.
We then enter Lincoln's Inn Fields, and pay a visit to No.
58, on the furthest or west side near Portsmouth Street.
This ancient mansion was the residence of Dickens's friend
and biographer, John Forster, before he went to live at Palace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Gate. It is minutely described in the tenth chapter of <i>Bleak
House</i> as the residence of Mr. Tulkinghorn, "a large house,
formerly a house of state, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. let off in sets of chambers
now; and in those shrunken fragments of its greatness lawyers
lie like maggots in nuts." The "foreshortened allegory in
the person of one impossible Roman upside down," who
afterwards points to the "new meaning" (<i>i. e.</i> the murder of
Mr. Tulkinghorn) has, it is to be regretted, since been whitewashed.
On the 30th November, 1844, here Dickens read
<i>The Chimes</i> to a few intimate friends, an event immortalized
by Maclise's pencil, and, as appreciative of the feelings of the
audience, Forster alludes "to the grave attention of Carlyle,
the eager interest of Stanfield and Maclise, the keen look of
poor Laman Blanchard, Fox's rapt solemnity, Jerrold's skyward
gaze, and the tears of Harness and Dyce."</p>

<img src="images/i_044.png" width="600" height="405" alt="Staple Inn, Holborn." title="" />
<span class="caption">Staple Inn, Holborn.</span>
</div>
<p>That celebrated tavern called the "Magpie and Stump,"
referred to in the twenty-first chapter of <i>Pickwick</i>,&mdash;where that
hero spent an interesting evening on the invitation of Lowten
(Mr. Perker's clerk), and heard "the old man's tale about the
queer client,"&mdash;is supposed to have been "The old George the
IVth" in Clare Market, close by. Retracing our steps through
Bishop's Court (where lived Krook the marine-store dealer,
and in whose house lodged poor Miss Flite and Captain
Hawdon, <i>alias</i> Nemo) into Chancery Lane, we arrive at the
point from whence we diverged, and turn into Cursitor Street.
Like other places adjacent, this street has been subjected
to "improvements," and it is scarcely possible to trace
"Coavinses," so well known to Mr. Harold Skimpole, or
indeed the place of business and residence of Mr. Snagsby,
the good-natured law stationer, and his jealous "little woman."
It will be remembered that it was here the Reverend Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Chadband more than once "improved a tough subject":&mdash;"toe
your advantage, toe your profit, toe your gain, toe
your welfare, toe your enrichment,"&mdash;and refreshed his own.
Thackeray was partial to this neighbourhood, and Rawdon
Crawley had some painful experiences in Cursitor Street.</p>



<p>Bearing round by Southampton Buildings, we reach Staple
Inn,&mdash;behind the most ancient part of Holborn,&mdash;originally a
hostelry of the merchants of the Wool-staple, who were
removed to Westminster by Richard II. in 1378. At No.
10 in the first court, opposite the pleasant little garden
and picturesque hall, resided the "angular" but kindly Mr.
Grewgious, attended by his "gloomy" clerk, Mr. Bazzard, and
on the front of the house over the door still remains the
tablet with the mysterious initials:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 188px;">
<img src="images/i_045.png" width="188" height="114" alt="Mysterious initials" title="" />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>but our enquiries fail to discover their meaning. Dickens
humorously suggests "Perhaps John Thomas," "Perhaps Joe
Tyler," and under hilarious circumstances, "Pretty Jolly too,"
and "Possibly jabbered thus!" They are understood to be
the initials of the treasurer of the Inn at the date above-mentioned.
It is interesting to state that the Inn has been
most appropriately restored by the enterprising Prudential
Assurance Company, who have recently purchased it; and on
the seat in the centre of the second Court (facing Holborn),
under the plane trees which adorn it, were resting a few wayfarers,
who seemed to enjoy this thoughtful provision made
by the present owners. We can picture in one of the rooms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
on the first floor of P. J. T.'s house (very memorable to the
writer of these lines, some brief part of his early life having
been passed there), the conference described in the twentieth
chapter of <i>Edwin Drood</i>, between Mr. Grewgious and his
charming ward,&mdash;so aptly pourtrayed by Mr. Luke Fildes in
his beautiful drawing, "Mr. Grewgious experiences a new sensation,"&mdash;as
well as all the other scenes which took place here.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">
<img src="images/i_046.png" width="379" height="500" alt="Barnard&#39;s Inn" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning into Holborn through the Archway of Staple Inn,
and stopping for a minute to admire the fine effect of the
recently restored fourteenth-century old-timbered houses of
the Inn which face that thoroughfare, a few steps lower down
take us to Barnard's Inn, where Pip in <i>Great Expectations</i>
lodged with his friend Herbert Pocket when he came to
London. Dickens calls it, "the dingiest collection of shabby
buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for
tom-cats." Simple-minded Joe Gargery, who visited Pip here,
persisted for a time in calling it an "hotel," and after his
visit thus recorded his impressions of the place:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The present may be a werry good inn, and I believe its
character do stand i; but I wouldn't keep a pig in it myself&mdash;not in
the case that I wished him to fatten wholesome and to eat with a
meller flavour on him."</p></div>

<p>A few plane trees&mdash;the glory of all squares and open spaces
in London, where they thrive so luxuriantly&mdash;give a rural
appearance to this crowded place, while the sparrows tenanting
them enjoy the sunbeams passing through the scanty
branches.</p>

<p>Our next halting-place, Furnival's Inn, is one of profound
interest to all pious pilgrims in "Dickens-Land," for there
the genius of the young author was first recognized, not only
by the novel-reading world, but also by his contemporaries
in literature. Thackeray generously spoke of him as "the
young man who came and took his place calmly at the head
of the whole tribe, and who has kept it."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 301px;"><a name="furnivals" id="furnivals"></a>
<img src="images/i_048.png" width="301" height="550" alt="Dickens House by Furnival&#39;s Inn" title="" />
</div>

<p>Furnival's Inn in Holborn, which stands midway between
Barnard's Inn and Staple Inn on the opposite side of the way,
is famous as having been the residence of Charles Dickens in
his bachelor days, when a reporter for the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
He removed here from his father's lodgings at No. 18, Bentinck
Street, and had chambers, first the "three pair back" (rather
gloomy rooms) of No. 13 from Christmas 1834 until Christmas
1835, when he removed to the "three pair floor south" (bright
little rooms) of No. 15, the house on the right-hand side of
the square having Ionic ornamentations, which he occupied
from 1835 until his removal to No. 48, Doughty Street, in
March 1837. The brass-bound iron rail still remains, and the
sixty stone steps which lead from the ground-floor to the top<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of each house are no doubt the same over which the eager
feet of the youthful "Boz" often trod. He was married from
Furnival's Inn on 2nd April, 1836, to Catherine, eldest
daughter of Mr. George Hogarth, his old colleague on the
<i>Morning Chronicle</i>, the wedding taking place at St. Luke's
Church, Chelsea, and doubtless lived here in his early matrimonial
days much in the same way probably as Tommy
Traddles did, as described in <i>David Copperfield</i>. Here the
<i>Sketches by Boz</i> were written, and most of the numbers of the
immortal <i>Pickwick Papers</i>, as also the lesser works: <i>Sunday
under Three Heads</i>, <i>The Strange Gentleman</i>, and <i>The Village
Coquettes</i>. The quietude of this retired spot in the midst of a
busy thoroughfare, and its accessibility to the <i>Chronicle</i> offices
in the Strand, must have been very attractive to the young
author. His eldest son, the present Mr. Charles Dickens,
was born here on the 6th January, 1837.</p>

<p>It was in Furnival's Inn, probably in the year 1836, that
Thackeray paid a visit to Dickens, and thus described the
meeting:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I can remember, when Mr. Dickens was a very young man,
and had commenced delighting the world with some charming
humorous works in covers which were coloured light green
and came out once a month, that this young man wanted an
artist to illustrate his writings; and I remember walking up
to his chambers in Furnival's Inn, with two or three drawings
in my hand, which, strange to say, he did not find suitable."</p>

<p>How wonderfully interesting these "two or three drawings"
would be now if they could be discovered! Of the
score or so of "Extra Illustrations" to <i>Pickwick</i> which have
appeared, surely these (if they were such) which Dickens "did
not find suitable," combining as they did the genius of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Dickens and Thackeray, whatever their merits or defects
may have been, would be most highly prized.</p>

<p>John Westlock, in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>, had apartments in
Furnival's Inn, and was there visited by Tom Pinch. Wood's
Hotel occupies a large portion of the square, and is mentioned
in <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i> as having been the Inn
where Mr. Grewgious took rooms for his charming ward Rosa
Bud, from whence he ordered for her refreshment, soon after
her arrival at Staple Inn to escape Jasper's importunities, "a
nice jumble of all meals," to which it is to be feared she did
not do justice, and where "at the hotel door he afterwards
confided her to the Unlimited head chamber-maid."</p>

<p>The Society of Arts have considerately put up on the house
No. 15 one of their neat terra-cotta memorial tablets with the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<span class="caption">No. 48, Doughty Street, Mecklenburgh Square.<br />
Dickens&#39;s Residence 1837-9.</span>
</div><p>We proceed along Holborn, and go up Kingsgate Street,
where "Poll Sweedlepipe, Barber and Bird Fancier," lived,
"next door but one to the celebrated mutton-pie shop, and
directly opposite the original cats'-meat warehouse." The
immortal Sairey Gamp lodged on the first floor, where
doubtless she helped herself from the "chimley-piece" whenever
she felt "dispoged." Here also the quarrel took place
between that old lady and her friend Betsey Prig anent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
that mythical personage, "Mrs. Harris." We pass through
Red Lion Square and up Bedford Row, and after proceeding
along Theobald's Road for a short distance, turn up John
Street, which leads into Doughty Street, where, at No. 48,
Charles Dickens lived from 1837 to 1839. The house,
situated on the east side of the street, has twelve rooms, is
single-fronted, three-storied, and not unlike No. 2, Ordnance
Terrace, Chatham. A tiny little room on the ground-floor,
with a bolt inside in addition to the usual fastening, is pointed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
out as having been the novelist's study. It has an outlook
into a garden, but of late years this has been much reduced in
size. A bill in the front window announces "Apartments
to let," and they look very comfortable. Doughty Street, now
a somewhat noisy thoroughfare, must have been in Charles
Dickens's time a quiet, retired spot. A large pair of iron
gates reach across the street, guarded by a gate-keeper
in livery. "It was," says Mr. Marzials in his <i>Life of
Dickens</i>, "while living at Doughty Street that he seems, in
great measure, to have formed those habits of work and
relaxation which every artist fashions so as to suit his own
special needs and idiosyncrasies. His favourite time for
work was the morning between the hours of breakfast and
lunch; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he was essentially a day worker and not a night
worker.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And for relaxation and sedative when he had
thoroughly worn himself with mental toil, he would have
recourse to the hardest bodily exercise.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. At first riding
seems to have contented him, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but soon walking took the
place of riding, and he became an indefatigable pedestrian.
He would think nothing of a walk of twenty or thirty miles,
and that not merely in the vigorous hey-day of youth, but
afterwards to the very last.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>



<p>It was at Doughty Street that he experienced a bereavement
which darkened his life for many years, and to which
Forster thus alludes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"His wife's next younger sister Mary, who lived with them,
and by sweetness of nature even more than by graces of
person had made herself the ideal of his life, died with a
terrible suddenness that for a time completely bore him down.
His grief and suffering were intense, and affected him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
through many after years." <i>Pickwick</i> was temporarily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
suspended, and he sought change of scene at Hampstead.
Forster visited him there, and to him he opened his heart.
He says:&mdash;"I left him as much his friend, and as entirely
in his confidence, as if I had known him for years."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 331px;">

<span class="caption">Tavistock House, Tavistock Square.<br />
Dickens&#39;s Residence 1851-60.</span>
</div>

<p>Some time afterwards, we find him inviting Forster "to join
him at 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> in a fifteen-mile ride out and ditto in, lunch
on the road, with a six o'clock dinner in Doughty Street."</p>

<p>Charles Dickens's residence in Doughty Street was but of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
short duration&mdash;from 1837 to 1840 only; but there he completed
<i>Pickwick</i>, and wrote <i>Oliver Twist</i>, <i>Memoirs of Grimaldi</i>,
<i>Sketches of Young Gentlemen</i>, <i>Sketches of Young Couples</i>, and
<i>The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby</i>. His eldest
daughter Mary was born here.</p>

<p>In proper sequence we ought to proceed to Dickens's third
London residence, No. 1, Devonshire Terrace, but it will be
more convenient to take his fourth residence on our way.
We therefore retrace our steps into Theobald's Road, pass
through Red Lion and Bloomsbury Squares, and along Great
Russell Street as far as the British Museum, where Dickens
is still remembered as "a reader" (merely remarking that it
of course contains a splendid collection of the original impressions
of the novelist's works, and "Dickensiana," as is
evidenced by the comprehensive Bibliography furnished by
Mr. John P. Anderson, one of the librarians, to Mr. Marzials'
<i>Life of Dickens</i>), which we leave on our left, and turn up
Montague Street, go along Upper Montague Street, Woburn
Square, Gordon Square, and reach Tavistock Square, at the
upper end of which, on the east side, Gordon Place leads us
into a retired spot cut off as it were from communication with
the rest of this quiet neighbourhood. Three houses adjoin
each other&mdash;handsome commodious houses, having stone
porticos at entrance&mdash;and in the first of these, Tavistock
House, Dickens lived from 1851 until 1860, with intervals at
Gad's Hill Place. This beautiful house, which has eighteen
rooms in it, is now the Jews' College. The drawing-room on
the first floor still contains a dais at one end, and it is said
that at a recent public meeting held here, three hundred and
fifty people were accommodated in it, which serves to show
what ample quarters Dickens had to entertain his friends.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Hans Christian Andersen, who visited Dickens here in 1857,
thus describes this fine mansion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In Tavistock Square stands Tavistock House. This and
the strip of garden in front are shut out from the thoroughfare
by an iron railing. A large garden with a grass-plat
and high trees stretches behind the house, and gives it a
countrified look, in the midst of this coal and gas steaming
London. In the passage from street to garden hung pictures
and engravings. Here stood a marble bust of Dickens, so
like him, so youthful and handsome; and over a bedroom
door were inserted the bas-reliefs of Night and Day, after
Thorwaldsen. On the first floor was a rich library, with a
fireplace and a writing-table, looking out on the garden;
and here it was that in winter Dickens and his friends acted
plays to the satisfaction of all parties. The kitchen was
underground, and at the top of the house were the bedrooms."</p>

<p>It appears that Andersen was wrong about the plays being
acted in the "rich library," as I am informed by Mr. Charles
Dickens that "the stage was in the school-room at the back
of the ground-floor, with a platform built outside the window
for scenic purposes."</p>

<p>With reference to the private theatricals (or "plays," as
Andersen calls them, including <i>The Frozen Deep</i>, by Wilkie
Collins, in which Dickens, the author, Mark Lemon, and others
performed, and for which in the matter of the scenery "the
priceless help of Stanfield had again been secured"), on a
temporary difficulty arising as to the arrangements, Dickens
applied to Mr. Cooke of Astley's, "who drove up in an open
phaeton drawn by two white ponies with black spots all over
them (evidently stencilled), who came in at the gate with a
little jolt and a rattle exactly as they come into the ring when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
they draw anything, and went round and round the centre
bed (lilacs and evergreens) of the front court, apparently
looking for the clown. A multitude of boys, who felt them
to be no common ponies, rushed up in a breathless state&mdash;twined
themselves like ivy about the railings, and were only

Mr. Cooke was not, however, able to render any assistance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arthur Ryland of The Linthurst, near Bromsgrove,
Worcestershire, who was present at Tavistock House on the
occasion of the performance of <i>The Frozen Deep</i>, informs me
that when Dickens returned to the drawing-room after the
play was over, the constrained expression of face which he
had assumed in presenting the character of Richard Wardour
remained for some time afterwards, so strongly did he seem to
realize the presentment. The other plays performed were
<i>Tom Thumb</i>, 1854, and <i>The Lighthouse</i> and <i>Fortunus</i>, 1855.</p>

<p>The following copy of a play-bill&mdash;in my collection&mdash;of one
of these performances is certainly worth preserving in a permanent
form, for the double reason that it is extremely rare,
and contains one of Dickens's few poetical contributions, <i>The
Song of the Wreck</i>, which was written specially for the occasion.</p>

<p>It was from Tavistock House that Dickens received this
startling message from a confidential servant:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The gas-fitter says, sir, that he can't alter the fitting of
your gas in your bedroom without taking up almost the ole
of your bedroom floor, and pulling your room to pieces. He
says of course you can have it done if you wish, and he'll do
it for you and make a good job of it, but he would have to
destroy your room first, and go entirely under the jistes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The same female, in allusion to Dickens's wardrobe, also
said, "Well, sir, your clothes is all shabby, and your boots
is all burst."</p>

<span class="caption">No. 141, Bayham Street, Camden Town,<br />
where the Dickens Family lived in 1823.</span>
</div>

<p>Among the important works of Charles Dickens which were
wholly or partly written at Tavistock House are:&mdash;<i>Bleak
House</i>, <i>A Child's History of England</i>, <i>Hard Times</i>, <i>Little
Dorrit</i>, <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, <i>The Uncommercial Traveller</i>,
and <i>Great Expectations</i>. <i>All the Year Round</i> was also determined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
upon while he lived here, and the first number was
dated 30th April, 1859.</p>

<p>Tavistock House is the nearest point to Camden Town,
interesting as being the place where, in 1823, at No. 16 (now
No. 141) Bayham Street, the Dickens family resided for a
short time<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> on leaving Chatham. There is an exquisite
sketch of the humble little house by Mr. Kitton in his
<i>Charles Dickens by Pen and Pencil</i>, and it is spoken of as
being "in one of the then poorest parts of the London
suburbs." We therefore proceed along Gordon Square,
and reach Gower Street. At No. 147, Gower Street,
formerly No. 4, Gower Street North, on the west side, was
once the elder Mr. Dickens's establishment. The house,
now occupied by Mr. M&uuml;ller, an artificial human eye-maker
("human eyes warious," says Mr. Venus), has six rooms,
with kitchens in basement. The rooms are rather small,
each front room having two windows, which in the case of
the first floor reach from floor to ceiling. It seems to be
a comfortable house, but has no garden. There is an old-fashioned
brass knocker on the front door, probably the
original one, and there is a dancing academy next door.
(Query, Mr. Turveydrop's?) The family of the novelist, which
had removed from Bayham Street, were at this time (1823) in
such indifferent circumstances that poor Mrs. Dickens had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
exert herself in adding to the finances by trying to teach, and
a school was opened for young children at this house, which
was decorated with a brass-plate on the door, lettered <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Dickens's Establishment</span>, a faint description of which
occurs in the fourth chapter of <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, and of
its abrupt removal "for the interests of all parties." These
facts, and also that of young Charles Dickens's own efforts
to obtain pupils for his mother, are alluded to in a letter
written by Dickens to Forster in later life:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I left, at a great many other doors, a great many circulars
calling attention to the merits of the establishment. Yet
nobody ever came to school, nor do I ever recollect that
anybody ever proposed to come, or that the least preparation
was made to receive anybody. But I know that we got on
very badly with the butcher and baker; that very often we
had not too much for dinner; and that at last my father was
arrested."</p>

<p>This period, subsequently most graphically described in
<i>David Copperfield</i> as the "blacking bottle period," was the
darkest in young Charles's existence; but happier times and
brighter prospects soon came to drown the recollections of
that bitter experience.</p>

<span class="caption">No. 1, Devonshire Terrace, Regent&#39;s Park.&mdash;Dickens&#39;s Residence 1839-50.</span>
</div>

<p>Walking up Euston Road from Gower Street, we see St.
Pancras Church (not the old church of "Saint Pancridge" in
the Fields, by the bye, situated in the St. Pancras Road,
where Mr. Jerry Cruncher and two friends went "fishing" on
a memorable night, as recorded in <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, when
their proceedings, and especially those of his "honoured parent,"
were watched by young Jerry), and proceed westward along
the Marylebone Road, called the New Road in Dickens's time,
past Park Crescent, Regent's Park, and do not stop until we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
reach No. 1, Devonshire Terrace. This commodious double-fronted
house, in which Dickens resided from 1839 to 1850, is
entered at the side, and the front looks into the Marylebone
Road. Maclise's beautiful sketch of the house (made in 1840),
as given in Forster's <i>Life</i>, shows the windows of the lower and
first floor rooms as largely bowed, while over the top flat of
one of the former is a protective iron-work covering, thus
allowing the children to come out of their nursery on the
third floor freely to enjoy the air and watch the passers-by.
In the sketch Maclise has characteristically put in a shuttlecock
just over the wall, as though the little ones were playing
in the garden. Forster calls it "a handsome house with a
garden of considerable size, shut out from the New Road by
a brick wall, facing the York Gate into Regent's Park;" and
Dickens himself admitted it to be "a house of great promise
(and great premium), undeniable situation, and excessive
splendour." That he loved it well is shown by the passage in
a letter which he addressed to Forster, "in full view of
Genoa's perfect bay," when about to commence <i>The Chimes</i>
(1844); he says:&mdash;"Never did I stagger so upon a threshold
before. I seem as if I had plucked myself out of my proper
soil when I left Devonshire Terrace, and could take root no
more until I return to it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Did I tell you how many
fountains we have here? No matter. If they played nectar,
they wouldn't please me half so well as the West Middlesex
water-works at Devonshire Terrace."</p>

<p>Mr. Jonathan Clark, who resides here, kindly shows us
over the house, which contains thirteen rooms. The polished
mahogany doors in the hall, and the chaste Italian marble
mantel-pieces in the principal rooms, are said to have been
put up by the novelist. On the ground floor, the smaller<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
room to the eastward of the house, with window facing
north and looking into the pleasant garden where the plane
trees and turf are beautifully green, is pointed out as having
been his study.</p>

<p>Mr. Benjamin Lillie, of 70, High Street, Marylebone,
plumber and painter, remembers Mr. Dickens coming to
Devonshire Terrace. He did a good deal of work for him
while he lived there, and afterwards, when he removed to
Tavistock House, including the fitting up of the library
shelves and the curious counterfeit book-backs, made to
conceal the backs of the doors. He also removed the furniture
to Tavistock House, and subsequently to Gad's Hill
Place. He spoke of the interest which Mr. Dickens used to
take in the work generally, and said he would stand for hours
with his back to the fire looking at the workmen. In the
summer time he used to lie on the lawn with his pocket-handkerchief
over his face, and when thoughts occurred to him,
he would go into his study, and after making notes, would
resume his position on the lawn. On the next page we give
an illustration of the courteous and precise manner&mdash;not
without a touch of humour&mdash;in which he issued his orders.</p>

<p>Here it was that Dickens's favourite ravens were kept, in
a stable on the south side of the garden, one of which died
in 1841, it was supposed from the effects of paint, or owing
to "a malicious butcher," who had been heard to say that he
"would do for him." His death is described by Dickens in
a long passage which thus concludes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On the clock striking twelve he appeared slightly agitated, but
he soon recovered, walked twice or thrice along the coach-house,
stopped to bark, staggered, exclaimed, '<i>Holloa, old girl!</i>' (his
favourite expression), and died."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 514px;">
<img src="images/i_066.png" width="514" height="600" alt="Letter to Mr. Lillie. Friday Tenth May 1861" title="" />
</div>


<p>In an interesting letter addressed to Mr. Angus Fletcher,
recently in the possession of Mr. Arthur Hailstone of
Manchester, Dickens further describes the event:&mdash;"Suspectful
of a butcher who had been heard to threaten, I had the body
opened. There were no traces of poison, and it appeared he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
died of influenza. He has left considerable property, chiefly
in cheese and halfpence, buried in different parts of the
garden. The new raven (I have a new one, but he is comparatively
of weak intellect) administered to his effects, and
turns up something every day. The last piece of <i>bijouterie</i>
was a hammer of considerable size, supposed to have been
stolen from a vindictive carpenter, who had been heard to
speak darkly of vengeance down the mews."</p>

<p>Maclise on hearing the news sent to Forster a letter, and
a pen-and-ink sketch, being the famous "Apotheosis." The
second raven died in 1845, probably from "having indulged
the same illicit taste for putty and paint, which had been fatal
to his predecessor." Dickens says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Voracity killed him, as it did Scott's; he died unexpectedly by
the kitchen fire. He kept his eye to the last upon the meat as it
roasted, and suddenly turned over on his back with a sepulchral cry
of '<i>Cuckoo!</i>'"</p></div>

<p>These ravens were of course the two "great originals" of
which Grip in <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> was the "compound." There
was a third raven at Gad's Hill, but he "gave no evidence
of ever cultivating his mind." The novelist's remarkable
partiality for ravens called forth at the time the preposterous
rumour that "Dickens had gone raving (raven) mad."</p>

<p>Here Longfellow visited Dickens in 1841, and thus referred
to his visit:&mdash;"I write this from Dickens's study, the focus
from which so many luminous things have radiated. The
raven croaks in the garden, and the ceaseless roar of London
fills my ears."</p>

</div>

<p>Dickens lived longer at Devonshire Terrace than he did
at any other of his London homes, and a great deal of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
best work was done here, including <i>Master Humphrey's
Clock</i> (I. <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>, II. <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>),
<i>American Notes</i>, <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>, <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, <i>The
Cricket on the Hearth</i>, <i>Dombey and Son</i>, <i>The Haunted Man</i>,
and <i>David Copperfield</i>. <i>The Battle of Life</i> was written at
Geneva in 1846. All these were published from his twenty-eighth
to his thirty-eighth year; and <i>Household Words</i>, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
famous weekly popular serial of varied high-class literature,
was determined upon here, the first number being issued on
30th March, 1850.</p>

<p>From Devonshire Terrace we pass along High Street, and
turn into Devonshire Street, which leads into Harley Street,
minutely described in <i>Little Dorrit</i> as the street wherein
resided the great financier and "master-spirit" Mr. Merdle,
who entertained "Bar, Bishop, and the Barnacle family" at
the "Patriotic conference" recorded in the same work, in
his noble mansion there, and he subsequently perishes "in
the warm baths, in the neighbouring street"&mdash;as one may
say&mdash;in the luxuriant style in which he had always lived.</p>

<p>Harley Street leads us into Oxford Street, and a pleasant
ride outside an omnibus&mdash;which, as everybody knows, is the
best way of seeing London&mdash;takes us to Hyde Park Place,
a row of tall stately houses facing Hyde Park. Here at
No. 5, (formerly Mr. Milner Gibson's town residence) Charles
Dickens temporarily resided during the winter months of
1869, and occasionally until May 1870, during his readings
at St. James's Hall, and while he was engaged on <i>Edwin
Drood</i>, part of which was written here; this being illustrative
of Dickens's power of concentrating his thoughts even near
the rattle of a public thoroughfare. In a letter addressed
to Mr. James T. Fields from this house, under date of 14th
January, 1870, he says:&mdash;"We live here (opposite the Marble
Arch) in a charming house until the 1st of June, and then
return to Gad's.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have a large room here with three
fine windows over-looking the park&mdash;unsurpassable for
airiness and cheerfulness."</p>

<p>A similar public conveyance takes us back to Morley's by
way of Regent Street, about the middle of which, on the west<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
side, is New Burlington Street, containing, at No. 8, the well-known
publishing office of Messrs. Richard Bentley and Son,
whose once celebrated magazine, <i>Bentley's Miscellany</i>, Dickens
edited for a period of two years and two months, terminating,
1838, on his resignation of the editorship to Mr. W. Harrison
Ainsworth; and we also pass lower down, at the bottom of
Waterloo Place, that most select of clubs, "The Athen&aelig;um,"
at the corner of Pall Mall, of which Dickens was elected a
member in 1838, and from which, on the 20th May, 1870, he
wrote his last letter to his son, Mr. Alfred Tennyson Dickens,
in Australia; and a tenderly loving letter it is, indicating the
harmonious relations between father and son. It expresses
the hope that the two (Alfred and "Plorn") "may become
proprietors," and "aspire to the first positions in the colony
without casting off the old connection," and thus concludes:&mdash;"From
Mr. Bear I had the best accounts of you. I told him
that they did not surprise me, for I had unbounded faith
in you. For which take my love and blessing." Sad to say,
a note to this (the last in the series of published letters)
states:&mdash;"This letter did not reach Australia until after these
two sons of Charles Dickens had heard, by telegraph, the
news of their father's death."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<p>At Morley's we refresh ourselves with Mr. Sam Weller's
idea of a nice little dinner, consisting of "pair of fowls and a
weal cutlet; French beans, taturs, tart and tidiness;" and
then depart for Victoria Station, to take train by the London,
Chatham and Dover Railway to Rochester.</p>

<p>The weather forecast issued by that most valuable institution,
the Meteorological Office (established since Mr.
Pickwick's days, in which doubtless as a scientist and
traveller he would have taken great interest), was verified to
the letter, and we had "thunder locally." On our way down
Parliament Street, we pass Inigo Jones's once splendid
Whitehall&mdash;now looking very insignificant as compared with
its grand neighbours the Government Offices opposite&mdash;remembering
Mr. Jingle's joke about Whitehall, which seems to
have been Dickens's first thought of "King Charles's head":&mdash;"Looking
at Whitehall, Sir&mdash;fine place&mdash;little window&mdash;somebody
else's head off there, eh, Sir?&mdash;he didn't keep a
sharp look out enough either&mdash;eh, Sir, eh?"</p>

<p>We also pass "The Red Lion," No. 48, Parliament Street,
"at the corner of the very short street leading into Cannon
Row," where David Copperfield ordered a glass of the very
best ale&mdash;"The Genuine Stunning with a good head to it"&mdash;at
twopence half-penny the glass, but the landlord hesitated
to draw it, and gave him a glass of some which he suspected
was <i>not</i> the "genuine stunning"; and the landlady coming
into the bar returned his money, and gave him a "kiss that
was half-admiring and half-compassionate, but all womanly
and good [he says], I'm sure."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;My magnificent order at the Public House&quot; (vide &quot;David Copperfield&quot;).</span>
</div>

<p>The Horse-Guards' clock is the last noteworthy object, and
reminds us that Mark Tapley noticed the time there, on the
occasion of his last meeting with Mary Graham in St. James's
Park, before starting for America. It also reminds us of Mr.
Micawber's maxim, "Procrastination is the thief of time&mdash;collar
him;"&mdash;a few minutes afterwards we are comfortably seated
in the train, and can defy the storm, which overtakes us
precisely in the manner described in <i>The Old Curiosity
Shop:</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It had been gradually getting overcast, and now the sky was
dark and lowering, save where the glory of the departing sun piled
up masses of gold and burning fire, decaying embers of which
gleamed here and there through the black veil, and shone redly
down upon the earth. The wind began to moan in hollow murmurs,
as the sun went down, carrying glad day elsewhere; and a train of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
dull clouds coming up against it menaced thunder and lightning.
Large drops of rain soon began to fall, and, as the storm clouds
came sailing onward, others supplied the void they left behind, and
spread over all the sky. Then was heard the low rumbling of
distant thunder, then the lightning quivered, and then the darkness
of an hour seemed to have gathered in an instant."</p></div>

<p>We pass Dulwich,&mdash;where Mr. Snodgrass and Emily
Wardle were married,&mdash;a fact that recalls kindly recollections
of Mr. Pickwick and his retirement there, as recorded in the
closing pages of the <i>Pickwick Papers</i>, where he is described
as "employing his leisure hours in arranging the memoranda
which he afterwards presented to the secretary of the once
famous club, or in hearing Sam Weller read aloud, with such
remarks as suggested themselves to his mind, which never
failed to afford Mr. Pickwick great amusement." He is
subsequently described as "somewhat infirm now, but he
retains all his former juvenility of spirit, and may still be
frequently seen contemplating the pictures in the Dulwich
Gallery, or enjoying a walk about the pleasant neighbourhood
on a fine day."</p>

<p>Although it is but a short distance&mdash;under thirty miles&mdash;to
Rochester, the journey seems tedious, as the "iron-horse" does
not keep pace with the pleasurable feelings of eager expectation
afloat in our minds on this our first visit to "Dickens-Land";
it is therefore with joyful steps that we leave the train,
and, the storm having passed away, find ourselves in the cool
of the summer evening on the platform of Strood and
Rochester Bridge Station.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>ROCHESTER CITY.</h3>

<div class="hang2">"The silent High Street of Rochester is full of gables, with old beams
and timbers carved into strange faces. It is oddly garnished with a
queer old clock that projects over the pavement out of a grave red
brick building, as if Time carried on business there, and hung out his
sign."&mdash;<i>The Seven Poor Travellers.</i></div>

<div class="hang2">"The town was glad with morning light."&mdash;<i>The Old Curiosity Shop.</i></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Mudfog</span>, Our Town, Dullborough, the Market Town, and
Cloisterham were the varied names that Charles Dickens
bestowed upon the "ancient city" of Rochester. Every reader
of his works knows how well he loved it in early youth, and
how he returned to it with increased affection during the
years of his ripened wisdom. Among the first pages of the
first chapter of Forster's <i>Life</i> we find references to it:&mdash;"That
childhood exaggerates what it sees, too, has he not tenderly
told? How he thought that the Rochester High-street must
be at least as wide as Regent Street which he afterwards discovered
to be little better than a lane; how the public clock
in it, supposed to be the finest clock in the world, turned out to
be as moon-faced and weak a clock as a man's eyes ever saw;
and how in its Town Hall, which had appeared to him once
so glorious a structure that he had set it up in his mind as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the model from which the genie of the Lamp built the palace
for Aladdin, he had painfully to recognize a mere mean little
heap of bricks, like a chapel gone demented. Yet, not so
painfully either when second thoughts wisely came. 'Ah!
who was I, [he says] that I should quarrel with the town
for being changed to me, when I myself had come back, so
changed, to it? All my early readings and early imaginations
dated from this place, and I took them away so full
of innocent construction and guileless belief, and I brought
them back so worn and torn, so much the wiser and so much
the worse!'"</div>

<p>It would occupy too much space in this narrative to
adequately give even a brief historical sketch of the City of
Rochester, which is twenty-nine miles from London, situated
on the river Medway, and stands on the chalk on the margin
of the London basin; but we think lovers of Dickens will
not object to a recapitulation of a few of the most noteworthy
circumstances which have happened here, and which are not
touched upon in the chapters relating to the Castle and
Cathedral.</p>

<p>According to the eminent local antiquary, Mr. Roach
Smith, F.S.A., the name of the city has been thus evolved:&mdash;"The
ceastre or chester is a Saxon affix to the Romano-British
(DU)RO. The first two letters being dropped in
sound, it became Duro or Dro, and then ROchester, and it
was the Roman station Durobrovis." The ancient Britons
called it "Dur-brif," and the Saxons "Hrofe-ceastre"&mdash;Horf's
castle, of which appellation some people think Rochester is a
corruption.</p>

<p>Rochester is a place of great antiquity, and so far back as
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 600 it seems to have been a walled city. Remains of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the medi&aelig;val Wall exist in very perfect condition, at the
back of the Eagle Inn in High Street, and in other parts of
the city. In 676 Rochester was plundered by Ethelred,
King of Mercia; and in 884 the Danes sailed up the Medway
and besieged it, but were effectually repulsed by King Alfred.
About 930, when three Mints were established there by
Athelstan, it had grown to be one of the principal ports of
the kingdom. William the Conqueror gave the town to his
half-brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux. Fires in 1130 and 1137
nearly destroyed it.</p>

<p>Not a few royal and distinguished personages have visited
Rochester on various occasions, among others Henry VIII.,
who came there in 1522, accompanied by the Emperor
Charles V. Queen Elizabeth came in 1573, when she stayed
five days, and attended the Cathedral service on Sunday.
She came again in 1583, with the Duke of Anjou, and showed
him her "mighty ships of war lying at Chatham." King
James I. also visited the city in 1604 and 1606. On the
latter occasion His Majesty, who was accompanied by
Christian IV., King of Denmark, attended the Cathedral, and
afterwards inspected the Navy. Charles II. paid it a visit
just before the restoration in 1660, and again subsequently.
It is believed that on both occasions he stayed at Restoration
House (the "Satis House" of <i>Great Expectations</i>) hereafter
referred to. Mr. Richard Head presented His Majesty with
a silver ewer and basin on the occasion of the restoration.
James II. came down to the quiet old city December 19th,
1688, and sojourned with Sir Richard Head for a week at
a house (now No. 46 High Street), from whence he ignominiously
escaped to France by a smack moored off Sheerness.
Mr. Stephen T. Aveling mentioned to us that "it is curious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
that Charles the Second 'came to his own' in Rochester, and
that James the Second 'skedaddled' from the same city."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Her Majesty when Princess Victoria stayed at the Bull Inn
in 1836 for a night with her mother, the Duchess of Kent,
on their way from Dover to London. It was a very
tempestuous night, some of the balustrades of Rochester
Bridge having been blown into the river, and the Royal
Princess was advised not to attempt to cross the bridge.</p>

<p>"On the last day of June 1667 (says Mr. W. Brenchley
Rye in his pleasant <i>Visits to Rochester</i>), Mr. Samuel Pepys,
after examining the defences at Chatham shortly after the
disastrous expedition by the Dutch up the Medway, walked
into Rochester Cathedral, but he had no mind to stay to the
service, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 'afterwards strolled into the fields, a fine walk,
and there saw Sir F. Clarke's house (Restoration House),
which is a pretty seat, and into the Cherry Garden, and here
met with a young, plain, silly shopkeeper and his wife, a
pretty young woman, and I did kiss her!'" David Garrick
was living at Rochester in 1737, for the purpose of receiving
instruction in mathematics, etc., from Mr. Colson. In 1742,
Hogarth visited the city, in that celebrated peregrination
with his four friends, and played hop-scotch in the courtyard
of the Guildhall. Dr. Johnson came here in 1783, and
"returned to London by water in a common boat, landing at
Billingsgate."</p>

<p>The city formerly possessed many ancient charters and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
privileges granted to the citizens, but these were superseded
by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835.</p>

<p>The Guildhall, "marked by a gilt ship aloft,"&mdash;"where the
mayor and corporation assemble together in solemn council
for the public weal,"&mdash;is "a substantial and very suitable
structure of brick, supported by stone columns in the Doric
order," and was erected in 1687. It has several fine portraits
by Sir Godfrey Kneller and other eminent painters, including
those of King William III., Queen Anne, Sir Cloudesley
Shovell, Richard Watts, M.P., and others. The Corporation
also possess many interesting and valuable city regalia,
namely, a large silver-gilt mace (1661), silver loving-cup
(1719), silver oar and silver-gilt ornaments (typical of the
Admiralty jurisdiction of the Corporation) (1748), two small
maces of silver (1767), sword (1871&mdash;the Mayor being
Constable of the Castle), and chain and badges of gold and
enamel (1875), the last-mentioned commemorating many
historical incidents connected with the city.</p>

<p>Emerging from the railway station of the London, Chatham
and Dover Company at Strood, a drive of a few minutes (over
the bridge) brings us to the first object of our pilgrimage,
the "Bull Inn,"&mdash;we beg pardon, the "Royal Victoria and
Bull Hotel,"&mdash;in High Street, Rochester, which was visited
by Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Tupman, Mr. Snodgrass, Mr. Winkle,
and their newly-made friend, Mr. Jingle, on the 13th May,
1827. Our cabman is so satisfied with his fare ("only a bob's
worth"), that he does not, as one of his predecessors did,
on a very remarkable occasion, "fling the money on the
pavement, and request in figurative terms to be allowed the
pleasure of fighting us for the amount," which circumstance
we take to be an improving sign of the times.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Changed in name, but not in condition, it seems scarcely
possible that we stand under the gateway of the charming old
inn that we have known from our boyhood, when first we
read our <i>Pickwick</i>, what time the two green leaves of <i>Martin
Chuzzlewit</i> were putting forth monthly, and when the name
of Charles Dickens, although familiar, had not become the
"household word" to us, and to the world, that it is now.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_079.png" width="500" height="424" alt="Bull Inn Rochester Good house Nice beds. vide Pickwick." title="" />
</div>

<p>We look round for evidence&mdash;"Good house, nice beds"&mdash;"(vide
<i>Pickwick</i>)" appear on the two sign-boards fixed on
either side of the entrance-gate. Only then are we quite
sure our driver has not made a mistake and taken us to
"Wright's next door," which every reader of <i>Pickwick</i>
knows, on the authority of Mr. Jingle, "was dear&mdash;very dear&mdash;half
a crown in the bill if you look at the waiter&mdash;charge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
you more if you dine out at a friend's than they would if you
dined in the coffee-room&mdash;rum fellows&mdash;very."</p>

<p>Haunches of venison, saddles of mutton, ribs of beef, York
hams, fowls and ducks, hang over our heads in the capacious
covered gateway; cold viands are seen in a glass cupboard
opposite, and silently promise that some good fare, like that
which regaled Mr. Pickwick and his friends, is still to be
found at the Bull. In the distance is seen the large old-fashioned
coach-yard, surrounded by odd buildings, which on
market days (Tuesdays) is crowded with all sorts of vehicles
ancient and modern. On our right is the kitchen, "brilliant
with glowing coals and rows of shining copper lying well
open to view."</p>

<p>By the kindness of Mr. Richard Prall, the town-clerk, beds
have been secured for us, and the landlord meets us at the
door with a hearty welcome. We are conducted to our rooms
on the second floor looking front, on reaching which a strange
feeling takes possession of us. Surely we have been here
before? Not a bit of it! But the bedrooms are nevertheless
familiar to us; we see it all in a minute&mdash;the writer's apartment
is Mr. Tupman's, and his friend's is Mr. Winkle's!</p>

<p>"Winkle's bedroom is inside mine," said Mr. Tupman, after
that delightful dinner of "soles, broiled fowl, and mushrooms,"
in the private sitting-room at the Bull, when all the other
Pickwickians had, "after the cosy couple of hours succeeding
dinner, more or less succumbed to the somniferous influence
which the wine had exerted over them," and he and Mr.
Jingle alone remained wakeful, and were discussing the idea
of attending the forthcoming ball in the evening.</p>

<p>It is an unexpected and pleasant coincidence that we are
located in these two rooms, and altogether a good omen for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
our tramp generally. They are numbered 13 and 19, and the
reason why the numbers are not consecutive is because 19
(Mr. Winkle's room) is also approached by a back staircase.
Mr. Pickwick's room, as befitted his years and his dignity as
G.C.M.P.C., is a larger room, and is number 17. They are all
comfortable chambers, with "nice beds."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_081.png" width="500" height="393" alt="Staircase at &quot;The Bull&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>The principal staircase of the Bull, which is almost wide
enough to drive a carriage and four up it, remains exactly
as it was in Mr. Pickwick's days, as described by Dickens and
delineated by Seymour. We could almost fancy we witnessed
the memorable scene depicted in the illustration, where the
irascible Dr. Slammer confronts the imperturbable Jingle.
The staircase has on its walls a large number of pictures and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
engravings, some curious and valuable, a few of which are
of purely local interest. A series of oil paintings represent
the costumes of all nations. There is a copy of "The Empty
Chair," from the drawing of Mr. Luke Fildes, R.A., and also
one of the scarce proof lithographs of "Dickens as Captain
Bobadil," after the painting by C. R. Leslie, R.A.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawrence informed us that some years ago "The
Owl Club" held its meetings at the Bull&mdash;a social club, reminding
us strongly of one of the early papers in <i>Bentley's
Miscellany</i>, illustrated by George Cruikshank, entitled the
"Harmonious Owls," which has recently been reprinted in
the collection called <i>Old Miscellany Days</i>, in which paper, by
the bye, are several names from Dickens.</p>

<p>In one of the cheerful private sitting-rooms, of which there
are many, we find a portrait of Dickens that is new to us.
Never have we seen one that so vividly reproduced the
novelist as one of us saw him, and heard him read, in the
Town Hall at Birmingham, on the 10th of May, 1866. It is a
vignette photograph by Watkins, coloured by Mr. J. Hopper,
a local artist, representing the face of the novelist in full,
wearing afternoon dress&mdash;black coat, and white shirt-front, with
gold studs&mdash;the attitude being perfectly natural and unconstrained,
and a pleasant calm upon the otherwise firm features.
The high forehead is surmounted by the well-remembered
single curl of brown hair, the sole survival of those profuse
locks which grace Maclise's beautiful portrait. The bright
blue eyes, with the light reflected on the pupils like diamonds,
seem to follow one in every direction. The lines, of course,
are marked, but not too strongly; and the faint hectic flush
which was apparent in later years&mdash;notably when we saw him
again in Birmingham in 1869&mdash;shows signs of development.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
The beard hides the neck, and the white collar is conspicuous.
Altogether it is one of the most successful portraits we
remember to have seen. As witness of its popularity locally,
we may mention that we saw copies of it at Major Budden's
at Gad's Hill, at the Mitre Hotel, Chatham, and at the
Leather Bottle Inn, Cobham. We are also informed that
Mr. Henry Irving gave a good sum for a copy, in the spring
of last year. Mr. Lawrence, our host, by good fortune,
happening to possess a duplicate, kindly allows us the opportunity
of purchasing it ("portable property" as Mr. Wemmick
remarks), as an addition to our Dickens collection which it
adorns. "Beautiful!" "Splendid!" "Dickens to the life!"
are the comments of friends to whom we show it, who
personally knew, or remembered, the original.</p>

<p>Here is the ball-room, entered from the first-floor landing
of the principal staircase, and the card-room adjoining,
precisely as it was in Mr. Pickwick's days:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was a long room with crimson-covered benches, and wax
candles in glass chandeliers. The musicians were confined in an
elevated den, and quadrilles were being systematically got through
by two or three sets of dancers. Two card-tables were made up in
the adjoining card-room, and two pair of old ladies, and a corresponding
number of old gentlemen, were executing whist therein."</p></div>

<p>A very little stretch of the imagination carries us back
sixty years, and, <i>presto!</i> the ball-room stands before us, with
the wax candles lighted, and the room filled with the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of
Chatham and Rochester society, who, acting on the principle
of "that general benevolence which was one of the leading
features of the Pickwickian theory," had given their support to
that "ball for the benefit of a charity," then being held there,
and which was attended by Mr. Tracy Tupman, in his new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
dress-coat with the P. C. button and bust of Mr. Pickwick in
the centre, and by Mr. Jingle, in the borrowed garments of
the same nature belonging to Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>"P. C.," said the stranger.&mdash;"Queer set out&mdash;old fellow's
likeness and 'P. C.'&mdash;What does 'P. C.' stand for? 'Peculiar
Coat,' eh?" Imagine the "rising indignation" and impatience
of Mr. Tupman, as with "great importance" he explains the
mystic device!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_084.png" width="500" height="384" alt="The &quot;Elevated Den&quot; in the Ball Room: (&quot;Bull&quot; Inn)" title="" />
</div>

<p>Everybody remembers how, declining the usual introduction,
the two entered the ball-room <i>incog.</i>, as "Gentlemen
from London&mdash;distinguished foreigners&mdash;anything;" how Mr.
Jingle said in reply to Mr. Tupman's remark, "Wait a
minute&mdash;fun presently&mdash;nobs not come yet&mdash;queer place&mdash;Dock-yard
people of upper rank don't know Dock-yard people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of lower rank&mdash;Dock-yard people of lower rank don't know
small gentry&mdash;small gentry don't know tradespeople&mdash;Commissioner
don't know anybody."</p>

<p>The "man at the door,"&mdash;the local M.C.,&mdash;announces the
arrivals.</p>

<p>"Sir Thomas Clubber, Lady Clubber, and the Miss
Clubbers!" "Commissioner&mdash;head of the yard&mdash;great man&mdash;remarkably
great man," whispers the stranger in Mr.
Tupman's ear.</p>

<p>"Colonel Bulder, Mrs. Colonel Bulder, and Miss Bulder,"
are announced. "Head of the garrison," says Mr. Jingle.
"They exchanged snuff-boxes [how old-fashioned it appears
to us who don't take snuff], and looked very much like a
pair of Alexander Selkirks&mdash;Monarchs of all they surveyed."</p>

<p>More arrivals are announced, and dancing begins in earnest;
but the most interesting one to us is Dr. Slammer&mdash;"a little
fat man, with a ring of upright black hair round his head,
and an extensive bald plain on the top of it&mdash;Dr. Slammer,
surgeon to the 97th, who is agreeable to everybody, especially
to the Widow Budger.&mdash;'Lots of money&mdash;old girl&mdash;pompous
doctor&mdash;not a bad idea&mdash;good fun,' says the stranger. 'I'll
dance with her&mdash;cut out the doctor&mdash;here goes.'" Then comes
the flirtation, the dancing, the negus and biscuits, the coquetting,
the leading of Mrs. Budger to her carriage. The volcano
bursts with terrific energy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"'You&mdash;you're a shuffler, sir,' gasps the furious doctor, 'a
poltroon&mdash;a coward&mdash;a liar&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;will nothing induce you
to give me your card, sir?'" and in the morning comes the
challenge to the duel. It all passes before our delighted
mental vision, as we picture the circumstances recorded in
the beloved <i>Pickwick</i> of our youth upwards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Here also is the bar, just opposite the coffee-room, where
the "Tickets for the Ball" were purchased by Mr. Tupman
for himself and Mr. Jingle at "half a guinea each" (Mr.
Jingle having won the toss), and where Dr. Slammer's friend
subsequently made inquiry for "the owner of the coat, who
arrived here, with three gentlemen, yesterday afternoon." We
find it to be a very cosy and comfortable bar-room too,
wherein we subsequently enjoy many a social pipe and
pleasant chat with its friendly frequenters, reminding us of
the old tavern-life as described in Dr. Johnson's days.</p>

<p>The coffee-room of the Bull, in which we take our supper,
remains unaltered since the days of the Pickwickians. It
is on the left-hand side as we enter the hotel from the
covered gateway&mdash;not very large, but warm and comfortable,
with three windows looking into the High Street. Many
scenes in the novels have taken place in this memorable
apartment&mdash;in fact, it is quite historical, from a Dickensian
point of view.</p>

<p>Here it was that the challenge to the duel from Dr.
Slammer to Mr. Winkle was delivered; and, when Mr.
Winkle appeared, in response to the call of the boots, that
"a gentleman in the coffee-room" wanted to see him, and
would not detain him a moment, but would take no denial,
"an old woman and a couple of waiters were cleaning the
coffee-room, and an officer in undress uniform was looking
out of the window." Here also the Pickwickians assembled
on that eventful morning when the party set out, three in a
chaise and one on horseback, for Dingley Dell, and encountered
such dire mishaps. "Mr. Pickwick had made his
preliminary arrangements, and was looking over the coffee-room
blinds at the passengers in the High Street, when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
waiter entered, and announced that the chaise was ready&mdash;an
announcement which the vehicle itself confirmed, by forthwith
appearing before the coffee-room blinds aforesaid."
Subsequently, as they prepare to start, "'Wo-o!' cried Mr.
Pickwick, as the tall quadruped evinced a decided inclination
to back into the coffee-room window."</p>

<p>It is highly probable that the descriptions of "the little
town of Great Winglebury," and "the Winglebury Arms," in
"The Great Winglebury Duel" of the <i>Sketches by Boz</i>, one of
the earliest works of the novelist, refer to the city of Rochester
and the Bull Inn, for they fit in very well in many respects,
although it <i>is</i> stated therein that "the little town of Great
Winglebury is exactly forty-two miles and three-quarters from
Hyde Park Corner."</p>

<p>The Blue Boar mentioned in <i>Great Expectations</i>&mdash;one of
the most original, touching, and dramatic of Dickens's novels&mdash;is
indubitably the Bull Hotel. Although there is an inn
in High Street, Rochester, called the Blue Boar, its description
does not at all correspond with the text. We find
several instances like this, where, probably for purposes of
concealment, the real identity of places and persons is
masked.</p>

<p>Our first introduction to the Blue Boar is on the occasion
of Pip's being bound apprentice to Joe Gargery, the premium
for whom was paid out of the twenty-five guineas given to
Pip by Miss Havisham. Pip's sister "became so excited by
the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would serve but we must
have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue Boar, and
that Pumblechook must go over in his chaise cart, and bring
the Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle." The dinner is duly disposed
of, and although poor Pip was frequently enjoined to "enjoy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
himself," he certainly failed to do so on this occasion. "Among
the festivities indulged in rather late in the evening," says
Pip, "Mr. Wopsle gave us <i>Collins's Ode</i>, and 'threw his
blood-stain'd sword in thunder down,' with such effect, that
a waiter came in and said 'The Commercials underneath sent
up their compliments, and it wasn't the Tumblers' Arms!'"
from which we gather that the said dinner took place in a
private sitting-room (No. 3) over the commercial room, on
the opposite side of the gateway to the coffee-room.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that on Pip's attaining "the second
stage of his expectations," Pumblechook had grown very
obsequious and fawning to him&mdash;pressed him to take refreshment,
as who should say, "But, my dear young friend,
you must be hungry, you must be exhausted. Be seated.
Here is a chicken had round from the Boar, here is a tongue
had round from the Boar, here's one or two little things had
round from the Boar that I hope you may not despise.
'But do I,' said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the
moment after he had sat down, 'see afore me him as I ever
sported with in his times of happy infancy? And may I&mdash;<i>may</i>
I&mdash;?' This 'May I?' meant might he shake hands?
I consented, and he was fervent, and then sat down again."</p>

<p>Returning to the coffee-room, we discover it was the
identical apartment in which the unexpected and very peculiar
meeting took place between Pip and "the spider," Bentley
Drummle, "the sulky and red-looking young man, of a heavy
order of architecture," both "Finches of the Grove," and
rivals for the hand of Estella. Each stands shoulder to
shoulder against the fire-place, and, but for Pip's forbearance,
an explosion must have taken place.</p>

<p>Through the same coffee-room windows, poor Pip looks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
under the reverses of his great expectations in consequence of
the discovery and subsequent death of his patron. The "servile
Pumblechook," who appears here uninvited, again changes
his manner and conduct, becoming ostentatiously compassionate
and forgiving, as he had been meanly servile in the time
of Pip's new prosperity, thus:&mdash;"'Young man, I am sorry to
see you brought low, but what else could be expected! what
else could be expected!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This is him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as I have rode
in my shay-cart; this is him as I have seen brought up by
hand; this is him untoe the sister of which I was uncle by
marriage, as her name was Georgiana M'ria from her own
mother, let him deny it if he can.' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>Dickens takes leave of the Blue Boar, in the last chapter
of the work, in these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall, had got
down to my native place and its neighbourhood, before I got there.
I found the Blue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found
that it made a great change in the Boar's demeanour. Whereas the
Boar had cultivated my good opinion with warm assiduity when I
was coming into property, the Boar was exceedingly cool on the
subject now that I was going out of property.</p>

<p>"It was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I
had so often made so easily. The Boar could not put me into my
usual bedroom, which was engaged,&mdash;probably by some one who had
expectations,&mdash;and could only assign me a very indifferent chamber
among the pigeons and post-chaises up the yard. But, I had as
sound a sleep in that lodging as in the most superior accommodation
the Boar could have given me, and the quality of my dreams was
about the same as in the best bedroom."</p></div>

<p>The visitors' book in the coffee-room, at the Bull&mdash;we
never shall call it "The Royal Victoria and Bull Hotel"&mdash;abounds
with complimentary remarks on the hospitable treatment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
received by its guests; and there are several poetical
effusions, inspired by the classic nature of "Dickens-Land."
One of these, under date of the 18th September, 1887, is
worth recording:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>

</div>

<p>We follow Mr. Pickwick's example as regards early rising,
and, taking a turn before breakfast, find ourselves on Rochester
Bridge. Nature has not much changed since the memorable
visit of that "truly great man," who in the original announcement
of <i>The Pickwick Papers</i> is stated with his companions
to have "fearlessly crossed the turbid Medway in an open
boat;" but the march of civilization has effaced the old
bridge, and lo! three bridges stand in the place thereof. The
beautiful stone structure (temp. Edward III.) which Mr.
Pickwick leant over, having become unsuitable, was blown up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
by the Royal Engineers in 1856, and a handsome iron bridge
erected in its place. The d&eacute;bris was removed by Mr. J. H.
Ball, the contractor, who presented Dickens with one of the
balustrades, others having been utilized to form the coping
of the embankment of the esplanade under the castle walls.
The iron bridge was built by Messrs. Fox and Henderson,
the foundations being laid in 1850. The machinery constituting
"the swing-bridge or open ship canal (fifty feet
wide) at the Strood end is very beautiful; the entire weight
to be moved is two hundred tons, yet the bridge is readily
swung by two men at a capstan." So says one of the Guide
Books, but as a matter of fact we find that it is not now used!
The other two bridges (useful, but certainly not ornamental)
belong to the respective railway companies which have
systems through Rochester, and absolutely shut out every
prospect below stream. What <i>would</i> Mr. Pickwick say, if his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
spirit ever visited the ancient city? Nevertheless, we realize
for the first time, with all its freshness and beauty (although
perhaps a little marred by the smoke of the lime-kilns, and
by the "Medway coal trade," in which it will be remembered
Mr. Micawber was temporarily interested, and which "he
came down to see"), the charm of the prospect which Dickens
describes, and which Mr. Pickwick saw, in the opening of the
fifth chapter of the immortal <i>Posthumous Papers:</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Bright and pleasant was the sky, balmy the air, and beautiful the
appearance of every object around, as Mr. Pickwick leant over the
balustrades of Rochester Bridge, contemplating nature, and waiting
for breakfast. The scene was indeed one, which might well have
charmed a far less reflective mind, than that to which it was presented.</p>

<p>"On the left of the spectator lay the ruined wall, broken in many
places, and in some, overhanging the narrow beach below in rude and
heavy masses. Huge knots of sea-weed hung upon the jagged and
pointed stones, trembling in every breath of wind; and the green ivy
clung mournfully round the dark and ruined battlements. Behind it
rose the ancient castle, its towers roofless, and its massive walls
crumbling away, but telling us proudly of its old might and strength,
as when, seven hundred years ago, it rang with the clash of arms, or
resounded with the noise of feasting and revelry. On either side, the
banks of the Medway, covered with corn-fields and pastures, with
here and there a windmill, or a distant church, stretched away as far
as the eye could see, presenting a rich and varied landscape, rendered
more beautiful by the changing shadows which passed swiftly across
it, as the thin and half-formed clouds skimmed away in the light of
the morning sun. The river, reflecting the clear blue of the sky,
glistened and sparkled as it flowed noiselessly on; and the oars of
the fishermen dipped into the water with a clear and liquid sound, as
their heavy but picturesque boats glided slowly down the stream."</p></div>

<p>It was over the same old bridge that poor Pip was pursued
by that "unlimited miscreant" Trabb's boy in the days of his
"great expectations." He says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury
wreaked upon me by Trabb's boy, when, passing abreast of me,
he pulled up his shirt-collar, twined his side hair, stuck an arm
akimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and
body, and drawling to his attendants: 'Don't know yah; don't
know yah, 'pon my soul, don't know yah!' The disgrace [continues
Pip] attendant on his immediately afterwards taking to crowing and
pursuing me across the bridge with crows, as from an exceedingly
dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith, culminated
the disgrace with which I left the town, and was, so to speak,
ejected by it into the open country."</p></div>

<p>There is generally a stiff breeze blowing on the bridge, and
the fact may probably have suggested to the artist the positions
of the characters in the river scene, one of the plates of
<i>Edwin Drood</i>, where Mr. Crisparkle is holding his hat on
with much tenacity. One other reference to the bridge occurs
in the <i>Seven Poor Travellers</i>, where Richard Doubledick, in
the year 1799, "limped over the bridge here with half a shoe
to his dusty foot on his way to Chatham."</p>

<p>After a Pickwickian breakfast in the coffee-room of "broiled
ham, eggs, tea, coffee, and sundries," we take a stroll up the
High Street. We do not know what the feelings of other
pilgrims in "Dickens-Land" may have been on the occasion
of a first visit, but we are quite sure that to us it is a perfect
revelation to ramble along this quaint street of "the ancient
city," returning by way of Star Hill through the Vines, all
crowded with associations of Charles Dickens. <i>Pickwick</i>,
<i>Great Expectations</i>, <i>Edwin Drood</i>, and many of the minor
works of the eminent novelist, had never before appeared so
clear to us&mdash;they acquire new significance. The air is full of
Dickens. At every corner, and almost at the door of every
house, we half expect to be met by one or other of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
characters who will claim acquaintance with us as their
friends or admirers. We are simply delighted, and never tire
of repeating our experience in the pleasant summer days of
our week's tramp in "Dickens-Land."</p>

</div>

<p>Starting from the Bull, and walking along the somewhat
narrow but picturesque street towards Chatham,&mdash;"the streets
of Cloisterham city are little more than one narrow street by
which you get into it and get out of it: the rest being mostly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
disappointing yards with pumps in them and no thoroughfare&mdash;exception
made of the Cathedral close, and a paved Quaker
settlement, in color and general conformation very like a
Quakeress's bonnet, up in a shady corner,"&mdash;we pass in
succession the Guildhall, the City Clock, Richard Watts's
Charity, the College Gate (Jasper's Gatehouse), Eastgate
House (the Nuns' House), and, nearly opposite it, the
residence of Mr. Sapsea, which, as we ourselves discover, was
also the residence of "Uncle Pumblechook." The latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
buildings are about a quarter of a mile from Rochester Bridge,
and are splendid examples of sixteenth-century architecture,
with carved oaken-timbered fronts and gables and latticed
bay-windows. Eastgate House&mdash;the "Nuns' House" of
<i>Edwin Drood</i>, described as "a venerable brick edifice, whose
present appellation is doubtless derived from the legend of
its conventual uses"&mdash;is especially beautiful, and its "resplendent
brass plate on the trim gate" is still so "shining
and staring." The date, 1591, is on one of the inside beams,
and the fine old place abounds with quaint cosy rooms with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
carved oak mantel-pieces, and plaster enrichments to the
ceilings, as well as mysterious back staircases and means of
exit by secret passages. Charles II. is said to have been
entertained here by Colonel Gibbons, the then owner, when
he visited Chatham and inspected the <i>Royal George;</i> but
this has been recently disputed. For many years during
this century, the house has been occupied as a Ladies' School,
and the old pianos used for practice by the pupils are there
still, the keys being worn into holes. We wonder whether
Rosa Bud and Helena Landless ever played on them! Looking
round, we half expect to witness the famous courting
scene in <i>Edwin Drood</i>, and afterwards "the matronly Tisher
to heave in sight, rustling through the room like the legendary
ghost of a dowager in silken skirts, [with her] 'I trust I disturb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
no one; but there <i>was</i> a paper-knife&mdash;Oh, thank you, I am
sure!'" An excellent local institution, called "The Rochester
Men's Institute," has its home here. The house has been
immortalized by Mr. Luke Fildes in one of the illustrations
to <i>Edwin Drood</i> ("Good-bye, Rosebud, darling!"), where, in
the front garden, the girls are cordially embracing their
charming school-fellow, and Miss Twinkleton looks on approvingly,
but perhaps regretfully, at the possible non-return
of some of the young ladies. Mrs. Tisher is saluting one
of the girls. There is a gate opening into the street, with
the lamp over it kept in position by an iron bracket, just as
it is now, heaps of ladies' luggage are scattered about, which
the housemaid and the coachman are removing to the car
outside; and one pretty girl stands in the gateway waving
a farewell to the others with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>We feel morally certain that Eastgate House is also
the prototype of Westgate House in the <i>Pickwick Papers</i>,
although, for the purposes of the story, it is therein located
at Bury St. Edmund's. The wall surrounding the garden is
about seven feet high, and a drop from it into the garden
would be uncommonly suggestive of the scene which took
place between Sam Weller and his master in the sixteenth
chapter, on the occasion of the supposed intended elopement
of one of the young ladies of Miss Tomkins's Establishment&mdash;which
also had the "name on a brass plate on a gate"&mdash;with
Mr. Charles FitzMarshall, <i>alias</i> Mr. Alfred Jingle.
The very tree which Mr. Pickwick "considered a very
dangerous neighbour in a thunderstorm" is there still&mdash;a
pretty acacia.</p>

</div>

<p>The house opposite Eastgate House was of course Mr.
Sapsea's dwelling&mdash;"Mr. Sapsea's premises are in the High<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Street over against the Nuns' House. They are of about the
period of the Nuns' House, irregularly modernized here and
there." A carved wooden figure of Mr. Sapsea's father in his
rostrum as an auctioneer, with hammer poised in hand, and a
countenance expressive of "Going&mdash;going&mdash;gone!" was many
years ago fixed over a house (now the Savings Bank) in St.
Margaret's, Rochester, and was a regular butt for practical
jokes by the young officers of the period, although they never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
succeeded in their attempts to pull it down. To us the house
appears to be an older building than Eastgate House, with
much carved oak and timber work about it, and in its prime
must have been a most delightful residence. The lower part
is now used as business premises, and from the fact that it
contains the little drawers of a seedsman's shop, it answers
very well to the description of Mr. Pumblechook's "eminently
convenient and commodious premises"&mdash;indeed there is not a
little in common between the two characters. "Mr. Pumblechook's
premises in the High Street of the market town [says
Pip] were of a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the
premises of a corn chandler and seedsman should be. It
appeared to me that he must be a very happy man indeed
to have so many little drawers in his shop; and I wondered
when I peeped into one or two of the lower tiers, and saw
the tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
seeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of
those jails, and bloom." Part of these premises is used as
a dwelling-house, and Mr. Apsley Kennette, the courteous
assistant town-clerk, to whom we were indebted for much
kind attention, has apartments on the upper floors of the
old mansion, the views from which, looking into the ancient
city, are very pretty. There is a good deal of oak panelling
and plaster enrichment about the interior, restored by Mr.
Kennette, who in the course of his renovations found an
interesting wall fresco.</p>

<p>He has had painted most appropriately in gilt letters over
the mantel-piece of his charming old panelled chamber of
carved and polished oak (with its quaint bay-window looking
into the street) the pathetic and sombre lines of Dante
Gabriel Rossetti:&mdash;</p>

<span class="caption">Restoration House.</span>
</div>

<p>The beautiful residence in Maidstone Road, formerly Crow
Lane, opposite the Vines, called Restoration House, is the
"Satis House" of <i>Great Expectations</i>&mdash;"Miss Havisham's up-town."
"Everybody for miles round had heard of Miss
Havisham up-town as an immensely rich and grim lady, who
lived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers,
and who led a life of seclusion." There is a veritable Satis
House as well, on the opposite side of the Vines alluded to
elsewhere. Restoration House, now occupied by Mr. Stephen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
T. Aveling, is a picturesque old Elizabethan structure, partly
covered with ivy, having fine oak staircases, floors, and wainscoted
rooms. Charles II. lodged here in 1660, and he
subsequently presented to his host, Sir Francis Clarke, several
large tapestries, representing pastoral scenes, which the present
owner kindly allowed us to see. The tapestry is said to have
been made at Mortlake. It was the usual present from
royalty in those days&mdash;just as Her present Majesty now gives
an Indian shawl to a favoured subject. Like many houses of
its kind, it contains a secret staircase for escape during times
of political trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. Aveling very kindly placed at our disposal the manuscript
of an interesting and "true ghost story" written by
him relating to Restoration House, which is introduced at
the end of this chapter.</p>

<p>Many names in Dickens's novels and tales appear to us
as old friends, over the shops and elsewhere in Rochester.
Looking through the list of Mayors of the city from 1654 to
1887, we notice nearly twenty of the names as having been
given by Dickens to his characters, viz. Robinson, Wade,
Brooker, Clarke, Harris, Burgess, Head, Weller, Baily, Gordon,
Parsons, Pordage, Sparks, Simmons, Batten, Saunders,
Thomson, Edwards, and Budden. The name of Jasper
also occurs as a tradesman several times in the city, but we
are informed that this is a recent introduction. In the
Cathedral burying-ground occur the names of Fanny Dorr<i>ett</i>
and Richard Pordage. Dartle, we were informed, is an old
Rochester name.</p>

<p>The population of the "four towns" of Rochester, Strood,
Chatham, and New Brompton, at the census of 1891, was
upwards of 85,000. The principal industries of Rochester<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
are lime and cement making, "the Medway coal trade," and
boat and barge building.</p>

<p>Rochester is very well off for educational institutions. In
addition to the Board schools, there is the King's (or
Cathedral) Grammar School founded by Henry VIII., a
handsome building in the Vines. The tuition fee commences
at &pound;15 per annum for boys under 12, and there is a
reduction made when there are brothers. There are two or
three annual competitive Scholarships tenable for a period of
years, and there are also two Exhibitions of &pound;60 a year to
University College, Oxford. There is also Sir J. Williamson's
Mathematical School in the High Street, founded in
1701, having an income of &pound;1500 a year from endowments,
and the teaching, which has a wide range, includes physical
science. The fees are very small, commencing at about &pound;5
per annum, and there are foundation Scholarships and
"Aveling Scholarships" to the value of &pound;20 per annum.</p>

<p>In addition to the famous Richard Watts's Charity, which
is described in another chapter, the city possesses several
other important charities, viz.:&mdash;St. Catherine's Charity on
Star Hill, founded by Simon Potyn in 1316, which provides
residences for sixteen aged females, with stipends varying
from &pound;24 to &pound;28 each; St. Bartholomew's Hospital in New
Road, which was founded in 1078 by Bishop Gundulph for
the benefit of lepers returning from the Crusades (the present
Hospital was erected in 1858, and is supported by voluntary
contributions); Sir John Hawkins's Hospital for decayed
seamen in Chatham, founded in 1592, and provides for twelve
inmates with their wives; and Sir John Hayward's Charity
on the Common, founded in 1651, which provides an asylum
for twelve poor and aged females, parishioners of St. Nicholas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Not least noteworthy among the numerous objects of
interest in the "ancient city" are the beautiful gardens
belonging to several of the houses in the High Street,
particularly those of Mr. Syms and Mr. Wildish. The fresh
green turf, the profusion of flowers, and the rich growth of
foliage and fruit, quite surprise and delight the stranger.
Mr. Stephen T. Aveling's garden is a marvel of beauty to be
seen in a town. "The Cloisterham gardens blush with
ripening fruit."</p>

<p>Some of the old-fashioned cries of street hawkers, as "hot
rolls," "herrings," "watercresses," and the like, similar to
those in the London of Charles Dickens's early days, still
survive at Rochester, and are very noticeable and quaint in
the quiet morning.</p>

<p>As illustrative of the many changes which have been
brought about by steam, even in the quiet old city of
Rochester, Mr. Syms called attention to the fact that fifty
years ago he could count twenty-eight windmills on the
surrounding heights, but now there are scarcely a dozen to
be seen.</p>

<p>In Rochester we heard frequent mention of "Gavelkind,"
one of the ancient customs of Kent, whereby the lands do not
descend to the eldest son alone, but to the whole number of
male children equally. Lambarde, the eminent lawyer and
antiquary (born 1536), author of <i>A Perambulation of Kent</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
says:&mdash;"I gather by <i>Cornelius Tacitus</i>, and others, that
the ancient Germans, (whose Offspring we be) suffered their
lands to descend, not to their eldest Sonne alone, but to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
whole number of their male Children: and I finde in the
75th Chapter of <i>Canutus</i> Law (a King of this Realm before
the Conquest), that after the death of the Father, his Heires
should divide both his goods, and his lands amongst them.
Now, for as much as all the next of the kinred did this
inherit together, I conjecture, that therefore the land was
called, either <i>Gavelkyn</i> in meaning, <i>Give all kyn</i>, because it
was given to all the next in one line of kinred, or <i>Give
all kynd</i>, that is, to all the male Children: for <i>kynd</i> in Dutch
signifieth yet a male Childe." The learned historian suggests
a second possible origin of this curious custom from the writ
called "Gavelles," to recover "the rent and service arising
out of these lands."</p>

<p>The remarkable custom of "Borough English," whereby the
youngest son inherits the lands, also survives in some parts of
the county of Kent.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Langton has done good service by giving in
his delightful book, <i>The Childhood and Youth of Charles
Dickens</i>, an illustration by Mr. W. Hull, of the old Rochester
Theatre, which formerly stood at the foot of Star Hill, and in
which Jingle and Dismal Jemmy&mdash;"rum fellow&mdash;does the
heavy business&mdash;no actor&mdash;strange man&mdash;all sorts of miseries&mdash;dismal
Jemmy, we call him on the circuit"&mdash;were to play
on the morrow after the duel. It exists no more, for the Conservative
Association has its club-house and rooms on the
site of the building. The theatre is referred to in <i>Edwin
Drood:</i>&mdash;"Even its drooping and despondent little theatre
has its poor strip of garden, receiving the foul fiend, when
he ducks from its stage into the infernal regions, among
scarlet beans or oyster-shells, according to the season of
the year." And again in <i>The Uncommercial Traveller</i>, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
"Dullborough Town," when the beginning of the end had
appeared:&mdash;</p>

<span class="caption">Old Rochester Theatre, Star Hill.</span>
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was To Let, and hopelessly so, for its old purposes; and there
had been no entertainment within its walls for a long time, except a
Panorama; and even that had been announced as 'pleasingly
instructive,' and I knew too well the fatal meaning and the leaden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
import of those terrible expressions. No, there was no comfort in
the Theatre. It was mysteriously gone, like my own youth. Unlike
my own youth, it might be coming back some day; but there was
little promise of it."</p></div>

<p>We did not stay at the Bull during the whole of our visit,
comfortable lodgings in Victoria Street having been secured
for us by the courtesy of Mr. Prall, the landlady of which,
from her kindness and consideration for our comfort, we are
pleased to recognize as a veritable "Mrs. Lirriper."</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>Among many reminiscences of Charles Dickens obtained
at Rochester, the following are the most noteworthy:&mdash;</p>

<p>We had an interesting chat with Mr. Franklin Homan,
Auctioneer, Cabinet-maker, and Upholsterer of High Street,
Rochester. Our informant did a good deal of work for
Charles Dickens at Gad's Hill Place, and remarked "he was
one of the nicest customers I ever met in my life&mdash;so
thoroughly precise and methodical. If anything had to be
done, he knew exactly what he wanted, and gave his instructions
accordingly. He expected every one who served him to
be equally exact and punctual."</p>

<p>The novelist wrote to Mr. Homan from America respecting
the furnishing of two bedrooms, describing in detail how he
wished them fitted up&mdash;one was maple, the other white with
a red stripe. These rooms are referred to in another chapter.
The curtains separating them from the dressing-rooms were
ordered to be of Indian pattern chintz. When Dickens came
home and saw them complete, he said, "It strikes me as if
the room was about to have its hair cut,&mdash;but it's my fault,
it must be altered;" so crimson damask curtains were
substituted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>In the little billiard-room near the dining-room was a one-sided
couch standing by the window, which did not seem to
please the master of Gad's Hill Place. He said to Mr.
Homan one day, "Whenever I see that couch, it makes me
think the window is squinting." The result was that Mr.
Homan had to make a window-seat instead.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when our informant was waiting in the
dining-room for some orders from Miss Hogarth, he saw
Dickens walking in the garden with a lady, to whom he was
telling the story of how as a boy he longed to live in Gad's
Hill Place, and determined to purchase it whenever he had
an opportunity.</p>

<p>Mr. Homan mentioned that the act drop painted by
Clarkson Stanfield, R.A., for <i>The Lighthouse</i> and the scene
from <i>The Frozen Deep</i>, painted by the same artist, which
adorned the hall at Gad's Hill Place, and which fetched such
enormous sums at the sale, were technically the property
of the purchaser of Tavistock House, but he said, "Perhaps
you would like to have them, Mr. Dickens," and so they
continued to be the property of the novelist.</p>

<p>The valuation for Probate was made by Mr. Homan, and
he subsequently sold for the executors the furniture and
other domestic effects at Gad's Hill Place. The art collection
was sold by Messrs. Christie, Manson, and Woods. There
was a very fine cellar of wine, which included some magnums
of port of rare vintage. Mr. Homan purchased a few bottles,
and gave one to a friend, Dr. Tamplin of London, who had
been kind to his daughter. At a dinner-party some time
afterwards at the Doctor's, a connoisseur being present, the
magnum in question was placed on the table, the guests being
unaware from whence it came. Reference was made to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
choice quality of the wine. "Yes," said the connoisseur, "it
<i>is</i> good&mdash;very fine. I never tasted the like before, except
once at Gad's Hill Place."</p>

<p>Mr. Homan recollects seeing among the plate two oak
cases which were not sold, containing the silver figures for
dining-table emblematic of spring, summer, and autumn.
These were the presents of a Liverpool admirer who wished
to remain anonymous. The incident is alluded to in Forster's
<i>Life</i>, the correspondent being described as "a self-raised man,
attributing his prosperous career to what Dickens's writings
had taught him at its outset of the wisdom of kindness and
sympathy for others, and asking pardon for the liberty he
took in hoping that he might be permitted to offer some
acknowledgment of what not only had cheered and stimulated
him through all his life, but had contributed so much
to the success of it." The letter enclosed &pound;500, but Dickens
declined this, intimating to the writer that if he pleased
to send him any small memorial in another form, he would
be glad to receive it.</p>

<p>The funeral was conducted by Mr. Homan, who mentioned
that Dickens's instructions in his Will were implicitly followed,
as regards privacy and unostentation. It was an anxious
time to him, in consequence of the changes which were made
in the arrangements, the interment being first suggested to
take place at St. Nicholas's Cemetery, then at Shorne, then
at Rochester Cathedral, and finally at Westminster Abbey.
The mourners, together with the remains, travelled early in
the morning by South Eastern Railway from Higham Station
to Charing Cross, where a procession, consisting of three
mourning-coaches and a hearse, was quietly formed. There
was neither show nor public demonstration of any kind. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
reaching Westminster Abbey, about half-past nine o'clock,
the procession was met by Dean Stanley in the Cloisters,
who performed the funeral service. A journalist being by
accident in the Abbey at the time of the funeral, Mr. Homan
remarked that he became almost frantic when he heard who
had just been buried, at having missed such an opportunity.</p>

<p>Mr. Homan possesses several souvenirs of Gad's Hill Place,
presented to him by the family, including Charles Dickens's
walking-stick, and photographs of the interior and exterior of
the house and the ch&acirc;let.</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>We were courteously received by the Rev. Robert Whiston,
M.A., who resides at the Old Palace, a beautiful seventeenth-century
house, abounding with oak panelling and carving,
on Boley Hill, bequeathed in 1674, by Mr. Richard Head,
after the death of his wife, to the then Bishop of Rochester
and his successors, who were "to hold the same so long as
the church was governed by Protestant Bishops." This
residence was sold by permission of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners,
together with the mansion at Brinley, in order to
help to pay for the new palace of Danbury in Essex.</p>

<p>Mr. Whiston was a friend of Charles Dickens, and is one
of the oldest inhabitants of Rochester. He was formerly
Head-Master of the Cathedral Grammar, or King's, School of
Henry VIII., an office which he resigned in 1877. Many
years previously, Mr. Whiston published <i>Cathedral Trusts
and their Fulfilment</i>, which ran through several editions, and
was immediately followed by his dismissal from his mastership,
on the ground that he had published "false, scandalous,
and libellous" statements, and had libelled "the Chapter of
Rochester and other Chapters, and also the Bishop." Much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
litigation followed&mdash;appeals to the Court of Chancery, the
Court of Queen's Bench, and Doctors' Commons, which
resulted in his replacement in office; and then a second
dismissal, followed by his pleading his own cause for five
days at Doctors' Commons against eminent counsel, and
after three years of litigation he was fully reinstated in his
office. The result at Rochester, for which Mr. Whiston
contended, was "an increase of &pound;19 for each of the twenty
scholars, and of &pound;35 for each of the four students, a total of
&pound;520 a year, and the restoration of the six bedesmen of the
Cathedral, with &pound;14 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a year each, who had disappeared
since 1810, making altogether &pound;608 a year." Reforms were
effected at other cathedrals, and handsome testimonials&mdash;one
from Australia&mdash;were presented to Mr. Whiston.</p>

<p>A characteristic paper, entitled "The History of a certain
Grammar School," in No. 72 of <i>Household Words</i>, dated 9th
August, 1851, gives a sketch of Mr. Whiston's labours, and
of the reforms which he effected. He is thus referred to:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But the Reverend Adolphus Hardhead was not merely a
scholar and a schoolmaster. He had fought his way against
disadvantages, had gained a moderate independence by the
fruits of early exertions and constant but by no means
sordid economy; and, while disinterested enough to undervalue
abundance, was too wise not to know the value of
money. He was an undoubted financialist, and never gave
a farthing without doing real good, because he always
ascertained the purpose and probable effect of his charity
beforehand. While he cautiously shunned the idle and
undeserving, he would work like a slave, with and for those
who would work for themselves; and he would smooth the
way for those who had in the first instance been their own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
pioneers, and would help a man who had once been successful,
to attain a yet greater success."</p>

<p>Anthony Trollope, in <i>The Warden</i>, also thus refers to
this gentleman:&mdash;"The struggles of Mr. Whiston have met
with sympathy and support. Men are beginning to say that
these things must be looked into."</p>

<p><i>Punch</i> has also immortalized Mr. Whiston, for in the
issue of 29th January, 1853, there is a burlesque account with
designs of "A stained glass window for Rochester Cathedral."
The design is divided into compartments; each containing a
representation in the medi&aelig;val fashion of a "Fytte" in "Ye
Gestes of Maister Whyston ye Confessour."</p>

<p>Mr. Whiston had dined at Gad's Hill several times, and
said that nothing could be more charming than Dickens's
powers as a host. Some years after his death, by a fortunate
circumstance, a large parcel of letters, written by the novelist,
came into the hands of Mr. Whiston, who had the pleasure
of handing them to Miss Hogarth and Miss Dickens, by
whom they were published in the collection of letters of
Charles Dickens.</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>Thomas Millen of Rochester informed us that he knew
Charles Dickens. His (Millen's) father was a hop-farmer,
and about the years 1864-5 lived at Bridgewood House, on
the main road from Rochester to Maidstone. One afternoon
in the autumn, Dickens, accompanied by Miss Hogarth and
his daughters, Mary and Kate, drove along the road, and
stopped to admire a pear tree which was covered with ripe
fruit. Millen happened to be in the garden at the time,
and while noticing the carriage, Dickens spoke to him, and
referred to the very fine fruit. Millen said, "Will you have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
some, sir?" to which Dickens replied, "Thank you, you are
very good, I will." He gave him some pears and some roses.
Dickens then said, "You have not the pleasure of knowing me,
and I have not the pleasure of knowing you. I am Charles
Dickens; and when you pass Gad's Hill, I shall take it
as a favour if you will look in and see my place." Millen
replied, "I feel it to be a great honour to speak to you, sir.
I have read most of your works, and I think <i>David Copperfield</i>
is the master-piece. I hope to avail myself of your kind
invitation some day." Dickens laughed, wished Millen
"Good-day," and the carriage drove on towards Maidstone.</p>

<p>"Some little time after," said Millen, "I was going to visit
an uncle at Gravesend, and drove over with a one-horse trap
by way of Gad's Hill. As I came near the place, I saw Mr.
Dickens in the road. He said, 'So you are here,' and I
mentioned where I was going. He took me in, and we went
through the tunnel, and by the cedars, to the ch&acirc;let, which
stood in the shrubbery in front of the house. He showed me
his work there&mdash;a manuscript on the table, and also some
proofs. They were part of <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, which was
then appearing in monthly numbers; and on that morning
a proof of one of the illustrations had arrived from Mr.
Marcus Stone. It was the one in which 'Miss Wren fixes
her idea.' I was then about sixteen or seventeen, and
Dickens said, 'You are setting out in life; mind <i>you</i> always
fix your idea.' He asked me what I was going to be, and I
said a farmer. He said, 'Better be that than an author or
poet;' and after I had had two glasses of wine, he bade me
'good-bye.'"</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>We were kindly favoured with an interview by the Misses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Drage, of No. 1 Minor Canon Row, daughters of the late Rev.
W. H. Drage, who was Curate of St. Mary's Church, Chatham,
from 1820 to 1828, and lived during that time in apartments
at No. 3 Ordnance Terrace, next door to the Dickens family.
Afterwards their father was Vicar of St. Margaret's, Rochester,
for many years, and resided in their present home. About
the year 1850, the Vicar, being interested in the daughter of
one of his parishioners, whom he was anxious to get admitted
into a public institution in London&mdash;a penitentiary or something
of the kind&mdash;wrote to Miss (now the Baroness) Burdett
Coutts, who was a patroness or founder, or who occupied
some position of influence in connection therewith. In answer
to the reverend gentleman's application, a letter was received
from Charles Dickens, then residing at Devonshire Terrace,
who appeared to be associated with Miss Burdett Coutts in
the management of the institution, proposing to call at Minor
Canon Row on a certain day and hour. The letter then
concluded with these remarkable words:&mdash;"I trust to my
childish remembrance for putting your initials correctly."</p>

<p>The letter was properly addressed "The Rev. <i>W. H.</i>
Drage," and it is interesting to record this circumstance as
showing Dickens's habitual precision and excellent memory.
The future novelist was about eleven years old when he left
Chatham (1823), consequently a period of twenty-seven years
or more must have elapsed since he knew his father's neighbour
as Curate there; yet, notwithstanding the multiplicity
and diversity of his occupations during the interim, his
recollection after this long period was perfectly accurate.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to add that the interview took
place (probably Dickens came down from London specially),
and that the Vicar obtained admission for his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i>. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
younger Miss Drage, who was in the room at the time of
Dickens's visit, particularly noticed what a beautiful head the
novelist's was, and in her enthusiasm she made a rough sketch
of it while he was talking to her father.</p>

<p>In conversation with the present Mr. Charles Dickens on
a subsequent occasion regarding this circumstance, he informed
me that there was an institution of the kind referred
to, "A Home," at Shepherd's Bush, in which his father took
much interest. Forster also says in the <i>Life</i> that this
Home "largely and regularly occupied his time for several
years."</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>We heard from a trustworthy authority, <i>Y. Z.</i>, at Rochester,
some particulars respecting an interesting custom at Gad's
Hill Place. On New Year's Eve there was always a dinner-party
with friends, and a dance, and games afterwards.
Some of the games were called "Buzz," "Crambo," "Spanish
Merchant," etc. Claret-cup and other refreshments were
introduced later, and at twelve o'clock all the servants came
into the entrance-hall. Charles Dickens then went in, shook
hands with them all round, wished them a Happy New Year
("A happy new year, God bless us all"), and gave each half-a-sovereign.
This custom was maintained for many years,
until a man-servant&mdash;who used to travel with Dickens&mdash;disgracefully
betrayed his trust,&mdash;robbed his master, in fact,&mdash;when
it was discontinued, and the name of the man who
had thus disgraced himself was never allowed to be mentioned
at Gad's Hill.</p>

<p>The same authority spoke of the long walks that Dickens
regularly took after breakfast&mdash;usually six miles,&mdash;but he
gave these up after the railway accident at Staplehurst, which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
it will be remembered, occurred, on the "fatal anniversary,"
the 9th June, 1865. During one of these walks, he fell in
with a man driving a cart loaded with manure, and had a
long chat with him, the sort of thing he frequently did (said
our informant) in order to become acquainted with the brogue
and feelings of the working people. When Dickens went on
his way, one of the man's fellow-labourers said to him, "Do
you know that that was Charles Dickens who spoke to you?"
"I don't know who it was," replied the man, "but he was a
d&mdash;&mdash;d good fellow, for he gave me a shilling."</p>

<p>Our informant also referred to a conversation between
Dickens and some of his friends at Gad's Hill, respecting the
unhappy marriages of actors. Twenty such marriages were
instanced, and out of these only two turned out happily. He
said that Charles Dickens at home was a quiet, unassuming
man. He remembers on one occasion his saying, in relation
to a war which was then going on, "What must the feelings
of a soldier be, when alone and dying on the battle-field, and
leaving his wife and children far away for ever?"</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>


<div class='center'><br />A TRUE GHOST STORY RELATING TO MISS HAVISHAM'S HOUSE.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I live in an old red-brick mansion, nearly covered with ivy&mdash;one
of those picturesque dwellings with high-pitched roofs and ornamental
gables, which were scattered broadcast over England in the days
of good Queen Bess. Every stranger looking at it exclaims, 'That
house must have a history and a ghost!' Many a story has been
told of the ghost which has from time to time been seen, or said to
have been seen, within its walls; and many a servant has, from fear,
refused service in this so-called haunted house.</p>

<p>"On the 28th May, one thousand six hundred and sixty, Charles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the Second sojourned and slept here. This being the eve of 'The
Restoration,' a new name was given to the then old house, which
name it has since retained. Charles, having knighted the owner (Sir
Francis Clarke), departed early the next morning for London.</p>

<p>"There are secret passages <i>in</i> the house, and, under ground, <i>from</i>
the house. From the room in which the king slept, a secret passage
through one of the lower panels of the wainscot, leads to various
parts of the house. This passage is so well concealed that I occupied
the house some years before it was discovered. I had occasion to
make a plan of the house, and the inside and outside not agreeing,
disclosed the space occupied by the unexplored passage. The
jackdaws had forestalled me in my discovery, and had had undisturbed
possession for two centuries, having got access through a
hole under the eaves of the roof. They had deposited <i>several bushels</i>
of sticks. They had not been the only tenants, as skeletons and
mummies of birds, etc., were also found.</p>

<p>"I came into possession of this old house in December 1875, and
on the 27th of April, 1876, slept in it for the first time. At ten
o'clock on that night, my family retired to rest; having some letters
to write, I sat up later. At a quarter to twelve, I was startled by a
loud noise&mdash;a sort of rumbling sound, which appeared to proceed from
the hall. I left my writing and went to the hall, and found that the
noise proceeded from the staircase, but I could see nothing unusual.</p>

<p>"The staircase is one of those so often described as being 'wide
enough to drive a carriage and pair up,' with massive oak posts and
balustrades. The walls are covered with tapestry, given to the house
by 'The Merry Monarch,' after his visit. An oak chest or two, and
some high-backed chairs on the landings, picture to one a suitable
habitation for a ghost. Fortunately, or unfortunately, I had no belief
in ghosts, and commenced an investigation of this extraordinary
noise.</p>

<p>"Could it be rats, or mice, or owls? No; the noise was ten
times louder than could possibly proceed from these creatures;
besides, I knew there were no rats in the house. The clever builder
of the house had filled all the space between the ceilings and floors
with silver sand, which rendered it impossible for a rat or mouse to
make passages. To prick a hole in a ceiling is to have a continuous
stream of sand run down, as from an hour-glass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"The noise was repeated, but much louder (two drum-sticks upon
a large drum would not have made more noise), and I was able to
localize it, still I could see nothing. I thought some one had fallen
on the stairs, and I shouted 'Who is there?' A reply came
'Hush!'&mdash;first softly, and then very loud&mdash;too loud for a human
voice. As no person was visible, I was puzzled, and went up-stairs
by a back staircase, and ascertained that none of my family had left
their bedrooms, and that certainly no trick was being played me.</p>

<p>"The same rumbling, rolling sound was repeated; and as I stood
on the top of the great staircase, I felt a little uncomfortable, but not
frightened. The noise seemed to proceed from a large carved oak
coffer or chest (as old as the house), which stood on a landing, about
half-way up the stairs. I approached the chest, and from it appeared
to come again the word 'Hush!' Could it be the wind whistling
through a crack? No; it was far too loud for any such explanation.
I opened the lid of the chest and found it empty. Again the noise,
now from <i>under</i> the chest. I was just strong enough to move the
chest; I turned it over and slid it down the stairs on to the next
landing. Again the noise, and again the 'Hush!' which now
appeared to come from the floor where the coffer had stood.</p>

<p>"I felt I would rather have had some one with me to assist in my
investigation, and to join me in making the acquaintance of the
ghost; but, although my sensations were probably the most uncomfortable
I ever experienced, I was determined, if possible, to unearth
the mystery.</p>

<p>"The light was imperfect, and I went to another part of the house
for a candle to enable me to examine the floor. In my absence the
noise was repeated louder than ever, and not unlike distant thunder.
On my return, I was saluted with 'Hush!' which I felt convinced
came from a voice immediately under the floor. By the light of the
candle I examined the dark oak boards, and discovered what appeared
to be a trap door about two feet six inches square. The floor
at some time had been varnished, and the cracks, or joints of the
trap, had been filled and sealed with the varnish. I now hoped I
had found the habitation of my troublesome and noisy guest. I
procured a chisel and cut the varnished joint, and found that there
was a trap door, as I supposed. By the aid of a long screwdriver I
was able to move the door, but at that moment a repetition of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
noise, immediately under me, made me hesitate for a moment to try
and raise it. With feelings better imagined than described, I raised
the lid, and looked into a dark chasm. All was still, and I heard the
cathedral bell tolling the hour of midnight. A long African spear
was in the corner near me, and I struck this into the opening. I
tied a string to the candlestick to lower it into the opening, but at
this moment I was startled, and was for the first time nervous, or
I may say, frightened; but this had better remain for another chapter.</p>

<p>"So far I have not in the smallest degree exaggerated or overdrawn
any one of the matters I have recounted. Every word has
been written with the greatest care to truth and accuracy.</p>

<div class='sig'>

<p>To cut our ghost story short, without adding another
chapter, Mr. Aveling, on looking into the dark chasm by the
meagre light of the lowered candle, beheld, to his amazement,
the reflection of his own face in the water of a large cistern
underneath the staircase, the house having formerly been
supplied from the "large brewery" a short distance off. The
unearthly noise was no doubt caused by air in the pipes,
through which the water rushed when suddenly turned on by
the brewers, who were working late at night. In <i>Great
Expectations</i> it is stated that:&mdash;"The brewery buildings had
a little lane of communication with it" [the courtyard of
Satis House], "and the wooden gates of that lane stood open"
[at the time of Pip's first visit, when Estella showed him over
the premises], "and all the brewery beyond stood open, away
to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.
The cold wind seemed to blow colder there, than outside the
gate; and it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at
the open sides of the brewery, like the noise of wind in the
rigging of a ship at sea."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>ROCHESTER CASTLE.</h3>

<div class="hang2">"I took up my hat, and went out, climbed to the top of the old Castle, and
looked over the windy hills that slope down to the Medway."&mdash;<i>The
Seven Poor Travellers.</i></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">To</span> the lover of Dickens, both the Castle and Cathedral of
Rochester appeal with almost equal interest. The Castle,
however, which stands on an eminence on the right bank of
the river Medway, close to the bridge, claims prior attention,
and a few lines must therefore be devoted to an epitome of its
history in the ante-Pickwickian days.</div>

<p>Tradition says that the first castle was erected by command
of Julius C&aelig;sar, when Cassivelaunus was Governor of Britain,
"in order to awe the Britons." It was called the "Castle of
the Medway," or "the Kentishmen's Castle," and it seems,
with other antagonisms, to have awed the unfortunate Britons
pretty effectively, for it lasted until decay and dissolution
came to it and to them, as to all things. It was replaced
by a new castle built by Hrofe (509), which in its turn
succumbed to the ravages of time.</p>

</div>

<p>Gundulph, Bishop of Rochester (1077), whose name still
survives here and there in connection with charities and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
other ways in the "ancient city," appears to be entitled to the
credit of having commenced to build the present massive
square Tower or Keep, the surviving portion of a magnificent
whole, sometimes called "Gundulph's Tower," "towards which
he was to expend the sum of sixty pounds," and this structure
ranks as one of the most perfect examples of Norman architecture
in existence. Other authorities ascribe the erection to
Odo, Bishop of Bayeux and Earl of Kent, half-brother to
William the Conqueror, who is described by Hasted as "a
turbulent and ambitious prelate, who aimed at nothing less
than the popedom." Later, in the reign of William Rufus, it
was accounted "the strongest and most important castle of
England." It was so important that Lambarde, in <i>A
Perambulation of Kent</i>, says:&mdash;"It was much in the eie of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
such as were authors of troubles following within the realme,
so that from time to time it had a part almost in every
Tragedie."</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Collins, in his compact and useful <i>Visitors'
Handbook of Rochester and Neighbourhood</i>, quoting from
another ancient historian, says that "In 1264, King Henry
III. [who in 1251 held a grand tournament in the Castle]
'commanded that the Shyriffe of Kent do set aboute to
finish and complete the great Tower which Gundulph
had left imperfect.'" About 1463, Edward IV. repaired
part of the Castle, after which it was allowed to fall into
decay. The instructions to the "shyriffe" were no doubt
necessary; for although &pound;60 would probably go a great way
in the time of Bishop Gundulph, the modern &aelig;sthetic builder
would do very little indeed for that sum, towards the erection
of such an impregnable fortress as Rochester Castle, the
walls of which vary from eight to thirteen feet in thickness,
whatever his progenitor may have done in 1077.</p>

<p>The Keep&mdash;the last resort of the garrison when all the
outworks were taken&mdash;is considered so beautiful that it is
selected, under the article "Castle" in the last edition of
the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, as an illustration of Norman
architecture, showing "an embattled parapet often admitting
of chambers and staircases being constructed," and showing
also "embattled turrets carried one story higher than the
parapet." There is also a fine woodcut of the Castle at
p. 198 of vol. v. of that work.</p>

<p>The Keep is seventy feet square and a hundred feet high,
built of the native Kentish ragstone and Caen stone; and the
adamantine mortar or cement used in its construction was
made with sand, evidently procured at the seaside some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
distance from Rochester, for it contains remains of cardium,
pecten, solen, and other marine shells, which would not be
found in river sand. Mr. Roach Smith suggested that probably
the sand may have been procured from "Cockle-shell
Hard," near Sheerness. He called our attention to the fact
that in Norman mortar sand is predominant, and in Roman
mortar lime or chalk.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_124.png" width="500" height="508" alt="Rochester Castle" title="" />
</div>

<p>The roof and the chambers are gone,&mdash;the Keep remains as
a mere shell,&mdash;and where bishops, kings, and barons came and
went, flocks of the common domestic pigeon, in countless
numbers, fly about and make their home and multiply. One
almost regrets the freedom which these graceful birds possess,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
although to grudge freedom to a pigeon is like grudging
sunshine to a flower. But though the damage to the walls is
really trifling, as they will stand for centuries to come, still
the litter and mess which the birds naturally make is considerable
and unsightly, and decidedly out of keeping in such a
magnificent ruin. The pigeons exhibit what takes place when
a species becomes dominant to the exclusion of other species,
as witness the pest of the rabbits in New Zealand. With
profound respect to his Worship the Mayor and the Corporation
of Rochester, to whom the Castle and grounds now
belong, the writer of these lines, as a naturalist, ventures to
suggest that the Castle should be left to the jackdaws, its
natural and doubtless its original tenants, which, although of
higher organization, have been driven out by superior numbers
in the "struggle for existence," and for whom it is a much
more appropriate habitat in keeping with all traditions; and
further, that the said pigeons be forthwith made into pies for
the use and behoof of the deserving poor of the ancient city
of Rochester.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of the fact that the Castle and
grounds are the property of the Corporation of Rochester.
They were acquired by purchase in 1883 from the Earl of
Jersey for &pound;8,000, and the occasion was celebrated by great
civic rejoicings.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The Corporation are not only to be congratulated
on the wisdom of their purchase ("a thing of
beauty is a joy for ever"), but also on the excellent manner
in which the grounds are maintained&mdash;pigeons excepted.
The gardens, with closely-cut lawns, abound with euonymus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
laurustinus, bay, and other evergreens, together with many
choice flowers. The single red, or Deptford pink (<i>Dianthus
Armeria</i>), grows wild on the walls of the Castle. There is a
tasteful statuette of her Majesty, under a Gothic canopy, near
the entrance, which records her Jubilee in 1887. The inscriptions
on three of the four corners are appropriately chosen
from Lord Tennyson's <i>Carmen S&aelig;culare:</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>

1887.<br />

<span class="smcap">L. Levy, Mayor.</span><br />

"Fifty years of ever-broadening commerce!"<br />

"Fifty years of ever-brightening science!"<br />

"Fifty years of ever-widening empire!"<br />
</div>

<p>There is free admission to the grounds through a handsome
modern Norman gateway, but a trifling charge of a few pence
is made for permission to enter the Keep, which has convenient
steps ascending to the top. From the summit of the
Keep, there are magnificent views of the valley of the river
Medway, the adjacent hills, Rochester, Chatham, and the
vicinity. The Cathedral, Jasper's Gatehouse, and Restoration
House, are also noteworthy objects to the lover of Dickens.
As Mr. Philips Bevan says, and as we verified, the views inside
at midday, when the sun is streaming down, are "very peculiar
and beautiful."</p>

<p>Dickens's first and last great works are both associated
with the Castle, and it is referred to in several other of his
writings. We can fancy, more than sixty years ago, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
eager and enthusiastic Pickwickians, in company with their
newly-made acquaintance, Mr. Alfred Jingle, seated outside
the four-horse coach,&mdash;the "Commodore," driven possibly by
"Old Chumley,"&mdash;dashing over old Rochester Bridge, to
"the lively notes of the guard's key-bugle," when the sight
of the Castle first broke upon them.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'Magnificent ruin!' said Mr. Augustus Snodgrass, with all the
poetic fervour that distinguished him, when they came in sight of
the fine old Castle.</p>

<p>"'What a study for an antiquarian!' were the very words which
fell from Mr. Pickwick's mouth, as he applied his telescope to
his eye.</p>

<p>"'Ah, fine place!' said the stranger, 'glorious pile&mdash;frowning
walls&mdash;tottering arches&mdash;dark nooks&mdash;crumbling staircases&mdash;'"</p></div>

<p>Little did poor Mr. Winkle think that within twenty-four
hours <i>his</i> feeling of admiration for Rochester Castle would be
turned into astonishment, for does not the chronicle say that
"if the upper tower of Rochester Castle had suddenly walked
from its foundation and stationed itself opposite the coffee-room
window [of the Bull Hotel], Mr. Winkle's surprise
would have been as nothing compared with the perfect
astonishment with which he had heard this address" (referring
of course to the insult to Dr. Slammer, and the challenge in
the matter of the duel).</p>

<p>It was on the occasion of "a visit to the Castle" very soon
afterwards that Mr. Winkle confided in, and sought the good
offices of, his friend Mr. Snodgrass, in the "affair of honour"
which was to take place at "sunset, in a lonely field beyond
Fort Pitt." Poor fellow! how eagerly he tried, under a
mask of the most perfect candour, and how miserably he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
failed, to arouse the energies of his friend to avert the
impending catastrophe.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/i_128.png" width="389" height="500" alt="Interior of Rochester Castle" title="" />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'Snodgrass,' he said, stopping suddenly, 'do <i>not</i> let me be
baulked in this matter&mdash;do <i>not</i> give information to the local
authorities&mdash;do <i>not</i> obtain the assistance of several peace officers
to take either me or Doctor Slammer of the 97th Regiment, at
present quartered in Chatham Barracks, into custody, and thus prevent
this duel;&mdash;I say, do <i>not</i>.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Snodgrass seized his friend's hand as he enthusiastically
replied, 'Not for worlds!'</p>

<p>"A thrill passed over Mr. Winkle's frame, as the conviction that
he had nothing to hope from his friend's fears, and that he was
destined to become an animated target, rushed forcibly upon him."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The state of the case having been formally explained to
Mr. Snodgrass, they make arrangements, hire "a case of
satisfaction pistols, with the satisfactory accompaniments of
powder, ball, and caps," and "the two friends returned to
their inn." The next ground which they traversed together
to pursue the subject was at Fort Pitt. We will follow
them presently.</p>

<p>In <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i> there is no direct reference
to the Castle itself, but the engraving of it, with the Cathedral
in the background, after the pretty sketch by Mr. Luke Fildes,
R.A., will ever be associated with that beautiful fragment.</p>

<p>Another reference is contained in the preface to <i>Nicholas
Nickleby</i>, where Dickens says:&mdash;"I cannot call to mind now
how I came to hear about Yorkshire schools when I was a
not very robust child, sitting in by-places near Rochester
Castle, with a head full of 'Partridge,' 'Strap,' 'Tom Pipes,'
and 'Sancho Panza.'"</p>

<p>A sympathetic notice of the Castle is also contained in the
<i>Seven Poor Travellers</i>. It begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Sooth to say, he [Time] did an active stroke of work in Rochester
in the old days of the Romans, and the Saxons, and the Normans,
and down to the times of King John, when the rugged Castle&mdash;I will
not undertake to say how many hundreds of years old then&mdash;was
abandoned to the centuries of weather which have so defaced the
dark apertures in its walls, that the ruin looks as if the rooks and
daws had picked its eyes out."</p></div>

<p>And this, the most touching reference of all, occurs in
"One Man in a Dockyard," contributed by Dickens<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to
<i>Household Words</i> in 1851:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"There was Rochester Castle, to begin with. I surveyed the
massive ruin from the Bridge, and thought what a brief little practical
joke I seemed to be, in comparison with its solidity, stature, strength,
and length of life. I went inside; and, standing in the solemn
shadow of its walls, looking up at the blue sky, its only remaining
roof, (to the disturbance of the crows and jackdaws who garrison
the venerable fortress now,) calculated how much wall of that thickness
I, or any other man, could build in his whole life,&mdash;say from
eight years old to eighty,&mdash;and what a ridiculous result would be
produced. I climbed the rugged staircase, stopping now and then
to peep at great holes where the rafters and floors were once,&mdash;bare
as toothless gums now,&mdash;or to enjoy glimpses of the Medway
through dreary apertures like sockets without eyes; and, looking from
the Castle ramparts on the Old Cathedral, and on the crumbling
remains of the old Priory, and on the row of staid old red-brick
houses where the Cathedral dignitaries live, and on the shrunken
fragments of one of the old City gates, and on the old trees with
their high tops below me, felt quite apologetic to the scene in
general for my own juvenility and insignificance. One of the river
boatmen had told me on the bridge, (as country folks do tell of such
places,) that in the old times, when those buildings were in
progress, a labourer's wages 'were a penny a day, and enough too.'
Even as a solitary penny was to their whole cost, it appeared to
me, was the utmost strength and exertion of one man towards the
labour of their erection."</p></div>

<p>Dickens always took his friends to the Keep of Rochester
Castle. He naturally considered it as one of the sights of
the old city. It was equally attractive to his friends, for a
curious adventure is recorded in Forster's <i>Life</i>, in connection
with a visit which the poet Longfellow made there in 1842,
and which he recollected a quarter of a century afterwards,
and recounted to Forster during a second visit, together with
a curious experience in the slums of London with Dickens.
The first of these adventures is thus described by Forster:&mdash;"One
of them was a day at Rochester, when, met by one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
those prohibitions which are the wonder of visitors and the
shame of Englishmen, we overleapt gates and barriers, and
setting at defiance repeated threats of all the terrors of law,
coarsely expressed to us by the custodian of the place,
explored minutely the castle ruins." Happily such a circumstance
could not now take place, for, by the present excellent
regulations of the Corporation of the city of Rochester, every
visitor can explore the Castle and grounds to his heart's
content.</p>

<p>On arriving at either railway station, Strood or Rochester
Bridge, the Castle is the first object to claim attention.
Our attention is constantly directed to it during our stay
in the pleasant city; it is a landmark when we are on the
tramp; and it is the last object to fade from our view as we
regretfully take our departure.</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>My fellow-tramp favours me with the following note:&mdash;</p>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">The Dedication of Rochester Castle to
the Public.</span></div>

<p>"I well remember the day of public rejoicing in the
picturesque city of Rochester, on the occasion of the ceremony
of formally presenting the old Castle and grounds to the
inhabitants. I had received instructions from the manager
of the <i>Graphic</i> newspaper to make sketches of the principal
incidents in connection with the day's proceedings, and I
reached my destination just in time to obtain from the
authorities some idea of the nature of those proceedings.
With this object in view, I made my way through the surging
crowd to the Guildhall, where, in one of the Corporation
rooms, I found a large assembly of local magnates in official<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
attire, including the Mayor, who was vainly endeavouring to
properly adjust his sword, an operation in which I had the
honour of assisting, much to his Worship's satisfaction, I
hope.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_132.png" width="500" height="328" alt="Rochester Castle and the Medway" title="" />
</div>

<p>"The streets of Rochester were thronged with excited
people, and the houses were gaily decked with flags and
bunting. When everything was ready, an imposing procession
was formed, and proceeded to the Castle grounds,
preceded by a military band; on arriving there, an address
was read from the pagoda to an attentive audience, the
subsequent proceedings being enlivened by musical strains.</p>

<p>"It had been announced that, in the evening, the old Keep
would be illuminated by the electric light, and I made a
point of being present to witness the unusual sight. The
night was very dark, and the ivy-clad ruin could barely be
distinguished; presently, a burst of music from the band was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
immediately followed by a remarkably strong beam of light,
which shot into the darkness with such effect as to fairly
startle those present. Then it rested on the grey walls of the
huge pile, bathing in brightness the massive stones and
clinging ivy, the respective colours of each being vividly
apparent. But the most striking feature was yet to come.
The hundreds of pigeons which inhabited the nooks and
crannies of the old Keep, being considerably alarmed by this
sudden illumination of their domain, flew with one accord
round and round their ancient tenement, now in the full blaze
of light, now lost in the inky darkness beyond, and fluttering
about in a state of the utmost bewilderment. Methinks even
Mr. Pickwick, had he been present in the flesh, would have
been equally amazed at this remarkable spectacle."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>ROCHESTER CATHEDRAL.</h3>

<div class="hang2">"That same afternoon, the massive grey square tower of an old Cathedral
rises before the sight of a jaded traveller. The bells are going for
daily Vesper Service, and he must needs attend it, one would say, from
his haste to reach the open Cathedral door. The choir are getting on
their sullied white robes, in a hurry, when he arrives among them,
gets on his own robe, and falls into the procession filing in to Service.
Then, the Sacristan locks the iron-barred gates that divide the
Sanctuary from the Chancel, and all of the procession having scuttled
into their places, hide their faces; and then the intoned words,
'<span class="smcap">When the wicked man</span>&mdash;' rise among the groins of arches and
beams of roof, awakening muttered thunder."&mdash;<i>Edwin Drood.</i></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> readers of Dickens are first introduced to Rochester
Cathedral, in the early pages of the immortal <i>Pickwick Papers</i>,
by that audacious <i>raconteur</i>, Mr. Alfred Jingle:&mdash;</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Old Cathedral too&mdash;earthy smell&mdash;pilgrims' feet worn away the
old steps&mdash;little Saxon doors&mdash;confessionals like money-takers'
boxes at theatres&mdash;queer customers those monks&mdash;Popes, and Lord
Treasurers, and all sorts of old fellows, with great red faces, and
broken noses, turning up every day&mdash;buff jerkins too&mdash;matchlocks&mdash;sarcophagus&mdash;fine
place&mdash;old legends too&mdash;strange stories: capital."</p></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>
<img src="images/i_135.png" width="600" height="381" alt="Rochester Cathedral" title="" />
</div>
<p>But it was through the medium of <i>Edwin Drood</i>, and
under the masked name of Cloisterham, that all the novel-reading
world beyond the "ancient city" first recognized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Rochester Cathedral&mdash;and indeed the ancient city too&mdash;as
having been elevated to a degree of interest and importance
far beyond that imparted to it by its own venerable history
and ecclesiastical associations, numerous and varied as they
are. The early portion of the story introduces us to
Cloisterham in imperishable language:&mdash;</p>



<div class="blockquot"><p>"An ancient city Cloisterham, and no meet dwelling-place for any
one with hankerings after the noisy world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A drowsy city
Cloisterham, whose inhabitants seem to suppose, with an inconsistency
more strange than rare, that all its changes lie behind it, and
that there are no more to come.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In a word, a city of another and
a bygone time is Cloisterham, with its hoarse cathedral bell, its hoarse
rooks hovering about the cathedral tower, its hoarser and less distinct
rooks in the stalls far beneath.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p></div>

<p>The particulars in this chapter mainly relate to <i>The
Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>, which Longfellow thought "certainly
one of Dickens's most beautiful works, if not the most beautiful
of all," but a few words may not be inappropriate respecting
some of the principal events connected with the Cathedral.
It was founded<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 604, by Ethelbert, King of Kent, and
the first bishop of the See (Bishop Justus) was ordained by
Augustine, the Archbishop of the Britons. The See of
Rochester is therefore, with the exception of Canterbury, at
once the most ancient and also the smallest in England.</p>

<p>The Cathedral, as well as the city, suffered from the attacks
of Ethelred, King of Mercia, and in 1075, "when Arnot, a
monk of Bec, came to the See, it was in a most deplorable
condition." Bishop Gundulph, who succeeded him, and by
whose efforts the Castle was erected, replaced the old English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
church by a Norman one (1080), and made other improvements.
The Cathedral suffered from fire in 1138 and 1179.
Its great north transept was built in 1235, and the great
south transept in 1240. In 1423, the parish altar of St.
Nicholas, in the nave, was removed to a new Church for the
citizens on the north side of the Cathedral. In 1470, the
great west window was inserted. The Norman west front
has a richly sculptured door of five receding arches, containing
figures of the Saviour and the twelve apostles, and statues of
Henry I. and his Queen, Matilda. There are monuments in
the Cathedral to St. William of Perth, a baker of that town,
who was murdered near here by his servant, on his way
to the Holy Land (1201), and was canonized, to Bishop
Gundulph, Bishop John de Sheppey, Bishop de Merton (the
founder of Merton College, Oxford), and to many others.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Phillips Bevan, "the chapter-house is
remarkable for its magnificent Decorated Door (about 1344), of
which there is a fac-simile at the Crystal Palace. The figures
represent the Christian and the Jewish Churches, surrounded
by Fathers and Angels. The figure at the top is the pure
soul for whom the angels are supposed to be praying."</p>

<p>Various alterations and additions have been made from
time to time, the last of which appears to be the central
tower, which is terribly mean and inappropriate, and altogether
out of place with the ancient surroundings. It was built by
Cottingham in 1825.</p>

<p>We pass, at various times, several pleasant hours in the
Cathedral and its precincts, admiring the beautiful Norman
work, and recalling most delightful memories of Charles
Dickens and his associations therewith.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 438px;">
<img src="images/i_138.png" width="438" height="600" alt="Rochester Cathedral Interior" title="" />
</div>

<p>Among the many friends we made at Rochester, was Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Syms, the respected Manager of the Gas Company, and an old
resident in the city. To this gentleman we are indebted for
several reminiscences of Dickens and his works. He fancies
that <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i> owed its origin to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
following strange local event that happened many years ago.
A well-to-do person, a bachelor (who lived somewhere near
the site of the present Savings Bank in High St., Rochester,
Chatham end), was the guardian and trustee of a nephew
(a minor), who was the inheritor of a large property. Business,
pleasure, or a desire to seek health, took the nephew to the
West Indies, from whence he returned somewhat unexpectedly.
After his return he suddenly disappeared, and
was supposed to have gone another voyage, but no one ever
saw or heard of him again, and the matter was soon forgotten.
When, however, certain excavations were being made for
some improvements or additions to the Bank, the skeleton of
a young man was discovered; and local tradition couples the
circumstance with the probability of the murder of the nephew
by the uncle.</p>

<p>Mr. Syms thought that the "Crozier," which is probably a
set off to the "Mitre," the orthodox hotel where Mr. Datchery
put up with his "portmanteau," was probably the city coffee-house,
an old hotel of the coaching days, which stood on the
site now occupied by the London County Bank. "It was a
hotel of a most retiring disposition," and "business was
chronically slack at the 'Crozier,'" which probably accounts
for its dissolution. Another suggestion is that the "Crozier"
may have been "The Old Crown," a fifteenth-century house,
which was pulled down in 1864. He could not identify the
"Tilted Wagon," the "cool establishment on the top of
a hill."</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that "Mr. Thomas Sapsea,
Auctioneer, &amp;c.," was a compound of two originals well
known in Rochester&mdash;a Mr. B. and a Mr. F., who had many
of the characteristics of the quondam Mayor of Cloisterham.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Mr. Sapsea's house is the fine old timbered building opposite
Eastgate House, which has been previously alluded to.</p>

<p>The "Travellers' Twopenny" of <i>Edwin Drood</i>, where
Deputy, <i>alias</i> Winks, lodged, Mr. Syms thought to have been
a cheap lodging-house well known in that locality, which
stood at the junction of Frog Alley and Crow Lane,
originally called "The Duck," and subsequently "Kitt's
Lodging-house." But, like less interesting and more important
relics of the past, this has disappeared, to make way
for modern improvements. It had been partly burnt down
before. To satisfy ourselves, we go over the ground, which is
near Mr. Franklin Homan's furniture establishment.</p>

<p>We are reminded, in reference to <i>Edwin Drood</i>, that the
chief tenor singer never heads the procession of choristers.
That place of honour belongs to the smaller boys of the
choir. An enquiry from us, as to what was the opinion of
the townsfolk generally respecting Dickens, elicited the reply
that they thought him at times "rather masterful."</p>

<p>We are most attentively shown over the Cathedral and its
surroundings by Mr. Miles, the venerable verger. This
faithful and devoted official, who began at the bottom of the
ladder as a choir boy in the sacred edifice at the commencement
of the present century, is much respected, and has
recently celebrated his golden wedding. Few can therefore
be more closely identified with the growth and development
of its current history. Pleasant and instructive it is to hear
him recount the many celebrated incidents which have marked
its progress, and to see the beautiful memorials of past
munificence or affection erected by friends or relatives, which
he lovingly points out. It is in no perfunctory spirit, or as
mere matter of routine, that he performs his office: we really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
feel that he takes a deep interest in his task, which makes it a
privilege to walk under his guidance through the historic
building, and into its famous crypt, so especially associated
with Jasper and Durdles.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 475px;">
<img src="images/i_141.png" width="475" height="355" alt="The Crypt, Rochester Cathedral." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Crypt, Rochester Cathedral.</span>
</div>

<p>We enter "by a small side door, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. descend the rugged
steps, and are down in the crypt." It is very spacious, and
vaulted with stone. Even by daylight, here and there, "the
heavy pillars which support the roof engender masses of
black shade, but between them there are lanes of light," and
we walk "up and down these lanes," being strangely reminded
of Durdles as we notice fragments of old broken stone ornaments
carefully laid out on boards in several places. Formerly
there were altars to St. Mary and St. Catherine in the crypt
or undercroft, but Mr. Wildish's local guide-book says:&mdash;"They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
seem not to have been much frequented; consequently these
saints were not very profitable to the priests."</p>

<p>We "go up the winding staircase of the great tower, toilsomely
turning and turning, and lowering [our] heads to
avoid the stairs above, or the rough stone pivot around which
they twist." About ninety steps bring us on to the roof of
the Cathedral over the choir, and then, keeping along a
passage by the parapet, we reach the belfry, and from thence
go on by ladder to the bell-chamber, which contains six bells&mdash;dark&mdash;very&mdash;long
ladders&mdash;trap-doors&mdash;very heavy&mdash;almost
extinguish us when lowering them&mdash;more ladders from bell-chamber
to roof of tower. The parapet of the tower is very
high; we can just see over it when standing on a narrow
ledge near the top-coping of the leaded roof. There are a
number of curious carved heads on the pinnacles of the tower,
and the parapet, to our surprise, appears to be about the same
height as the top of the Castle Keep. A panoramic view
of Cloisterham presents itself to our view (alas! not by
moonlight, as in the story), "its ruined habitations and sanctuaries
of the dead at the tower's base; its moss-softened,
red-tiled roofs and red-brick houses of the living, clustered
beyond."</p>

<p>We are anxious to go round the triforium, but there is no
passage through the arches; it was closed, we are told, at the
time of the restoration, about fifteen years ago, when the walls
of the Cathedral were pinned for safety. The verger, on
being asked, said he did not call to mind that Dickens ever
went round the triforium or ascended the tower. If this is so,
then much of the wonderful description of that "unaccountable
sort of expedition," in the twelfth chapter of <i>Edwin
Drood</i>, must have been written from imagination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>As it is Sunday, and as the summer is nearly over, Mr.
Miles, with a feeling akin to that which George Eliot has
expressed regarding imperfect work:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"but God be praised,</span><br />
Antonio Stradivari has an eye<br />
That winces at false work and loves the true,"&mdash;<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>apologetically explains that one-half the choir are absent on
leave, and perhaps we shall not have the musical portion of
the service conducted with that degree of efficiency which, as
visitors, we may have expected. Nevertheless we attend the
afternoon service; and Mendelssohn's glorious anthem, "If
with all your hearts," appeals to us with enhanced effect, from
the exquisite rendering of it by the gifted pure tenor who
takes the solo, followed by the delicate harmonies of the
choir, as the sound waves carry them upwards through and
around the arches, and from the sublime emotions called
into being by the impassioned appeal of the Hebrew prophet.</div>

<p>We study "the fantastic carvings on the under brackets of
the stall seats," and examine the lectern described as "the
big brass eagle holding the sacred books upon his wings," and
in imagination can almost call up the last scene described in
<i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>, where Her Royal Highness,
the Princess Puffer, "grins," and "shakes both fists at the
leader of the choir," and "Deputy peeps, sharp-eyed, through
the bars, and stares astounded from the threatener to the
threatened."</p>

<p>Upon being interrogated as to whether he knew Charles
Dickens, our guide immediately answers with a smile&mdash;"Knew
him! yes. He came here very often, and I knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
him very well. The fact is, they want to make me out to
be 'Tope.'" And indeed there appears to be such a relevancy
in the association, that we frequently find ourselves addressing
him as "Mr. Tope," at which he good-humouredly laughs.
He further states that Dickens was frequently in Rochester,
and especially so when writing <i>Edwin Drood</i>, and appeared
to be studying the Cathedral and its surroundings very
attentively.</p>

<p>The next question we put is:&mdash;"Was there ever such a
person as Durdles?" to which he replies, "Of course there
was,&mdash;a drunken old German stonemason, about thirty years
ago, who was always prowling about the Cathedral trying to
pick up little bits of broken stone ornaments, carved heads,
crockets, finials, and such like, which he carried about in
a cotton handkerchief, and which may have suggested to
Dickens the idea of the 'slouching' Durdles and his inseparable
dinner bundle. He used to work for a certain Squire
N&mdash;&mdash;." His earnings mostly went to "The Fortune of
War,"&mdash;now called "The Life-Boat,"&mdash;the inn where he
lodged.</p>

<p>Mr. Miles does not remember the prototypes of any other
"cathedraly" characters&mdash;Crisparkle and the rest&mdash;but he
quite agrees with the general opinion previously referred to
as to the origin of Mr. Sapsea. He considers "Deputy" (the
imp-like satellite of Durdles and the "Kinfreederel") to be
decidedly a street Arab, the type of which is more common
in London than in Rochester. He thinks that the fact of
the rooms over the gatehouse having once been occupied by
an organ-blower of the Cathedral may have prompted Dickens
to make it the residence of the choir-master. He also throws
out the suggestion that the discovery in 1825 of the effigy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of Bishop John de Sheppey, who died in 1360, may possibly
have given rise to the idea of the "old 'uns" in the crypt,
the frequent object of Durdles's search, <i>e.g.</i> "Durdles come
upon the old chap (in reference to a buried magnate of
ancient time and high degree) by striking right into the coffin
with his pick. The old chap gave Durdles a look with his
open eyes as much as to say, 'Is your name Durdles? Why,
my man, I've been waiting for you a Devil of a time!' and
then he turned to powder. With a two-foot rule always in
his pocket, and a mason's hammer all but always in his hand,
Durdles goes continually sounding and tapping all about and
about the Cathedral; and whenever he says to Tope, 'Tope,
here's another old 'un in here!' Tope announces it to the
Dean as an established discovery."</p>

</div>

<p>On the south side of the Cathedral is the curious little
terrace of old-fashioned houses, about seven in number, called
"Minor Canon Row"&mdash;"a wonderfully quaint row of red-brick
tenements" (Dickens's name for it is "Minor Canon
Corner"),&mdash;chiefly occupied by the officers and others attached
to the Cathedral. Here it was that Mr. Crisparkle dwelt with
his mother, and where the little party was held (after the
dinner at which Mr. Luke Honeythunder, with his "Curse
your souls and bodies&mdash;come here and be blessed" philanthropy,
was present, and caused "a most doleful breakdown"),
which included Miss Twinkleton, the Landlesses, Rosa Bud,
and Edwin Drood, as shown in the illustration, "At the
Piano." The Reverend Septimus Crisparkle's mother, who
is the hostess (and celebrated for her wonderful closet with
stores of pickles, jams, biscuits, and cordials), is beautifully
described in the story:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"What is prettier than an old lady&mdash;except a young lady&mdash;when
her eyes are bright, when her figure is trim and compact, when her
face is cheerful and calm, when her dress is as the dress of a china
shepherdess: so dainty in its colours, so individually assorted to
herself, so neatly moulded on her? Nothing is prettier, thought
the good Minor Canon frequently, when taking his seat at table
opposite his long-widowed mother. Her thought at such times may
be condensed into the two words that oftenest did duty together in
all her conversations: 'My Sept.'"</p></div>

<p>The backs of the houses have very pretty gardens, and,
as evidence of the pleasant and healthy atmosphere of the
locality, we notice beautiful specimens of the ilex, arbutus,
euonymus, and fig, the last-named being in fruit. The
wall-rue (<i>Asplenium ruta-muraria</i>) is found hereabout. There,
too, is a Virginia creeper, but we do not observe one growing
on the Cathedral walls, as described in <i>Edwin Drood</i>. Jackdaws
fly about the tower, but there are no rooks, as also
stated. Near Minor Canon Row, to the right of Boley Hill
(or "Bully Hill," as it is sometimes called), is the "paved
Quaker settlement," a sedate row of about a dozen houses
"up in a shady corner."</p>

<p>"Jasper's Gatehouse" of the work above mentioned is
certainly an object of great interest to the lover of Dickens,
as many of the remarkable scenes in <i>Edwin Drood</i> took
place there. It is briefly described as "an old stone gatehouse
crossing the Close, with an arched thoroughfare passing
beneath it. Through its latticed window, a fire shines out
upon the fast-darkening scene, involving in shadow the
pendent masses of ivy and creeper covering the building's
front." There are <i>three</i> Gatehouses near the Cathedral, a
fact which proves somewhat embarrassing to those anxious
to identify the original of that so carefully described in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the story. A short description of these may not be uninteresting.</p>

</div>

<p>(<span class="smcap">a</span>) "College Yard Gate," "Cemetery Gate," and "Chertsey's
Gate," are the respective names of what we know as "Jasper's
Gatehouse." It is a picturesque stone structure, weather-boarded
above the massive archway, and abuts on the High
Street about a hundred yards north of the Cathedral. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of the old houses near have recently been demolished, with
the result that the Gatehouse now stands out in bold relief
against the main thoroughfare of the city. No "pendent
masses of ivy" or "creeper" cover it. The Gate was named
"Chertsey" after Edward Chertsey, a gentleman who lived
and owned property near in the time of Edward IV., and
the Cathedral authorities still continue to use the old name,
"Chertsey's Gate." The place was recently the residence of
the under-porter of the Cathedral, and is now occupied by
poor people. There are four rooms, two below and two above.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">b</span>) "Prior's Gate" is a castellated stone structure partly
covered with ivy, standing about a hundred yards south
of the Cathedral, and is not now utilized in any way.
There is only one room, approached by a winding staircase
or "postern stair." The Gate was formerly used
as a school for choristers, until the new building of the
Choir School was opened in Minor Canon Row about three
years ago.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">c</span>) The "Deanery Gatehouse" is the name of a quaint
and very cosy old house, having ten rooms, some of which,
together with the staircase, are beautifully panelled; its
position is a little higher up to the eastward of the College
Yard Gate, and adjoining the Cathedral, while a gateway
passage under it leads to the Deanery. The house was
formerly the official residence of the Hon. and Reverend
Canon Hotham, who was appointed a Canon in residence in
1808, and lived here at intervals until about 1850, when the
Canonry was suppressed. Of all the Gatehouses, this is the
only one suitable for the residence of a person in Jasper's
position, who was enabled to offer befitting hospitality to
his nephew and Neville Landless. Formerly there was an
entrance into the Cathedral from this house, which is now
occupied by Mr. Day and his family, who kindly allowed us
to inspect it. We were informed that locally it is sometimes
called "Jasper's Gatehouse." The interior of the drawing-room
on the upper floor presents a very strong resemblance
to Mr. Luke Fildes's illustration, "On dangerous ground."
Accordingly, to settle the question of identity, I wrote to
Mr. Fildes, whose interesting and courteous reply to my
inquiries is conclusive. Before giving it, however, I may
mention that my fellow-tramp, Mr. Kitton, suggested, more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
particularly with reference to another illustration in <i>Edwin
Drood</i>, viz., "Durdles cautions Mr. Sapsea against boasting,"
that, for the purposes of the story, the Prior's Gate is placed
where the College Yard Gate actually stands.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"The background of the drawing of 'Durdles
cautioning Sapsea,' I believe I sketched from what you call
A., <i>i. e.</i> The College Gate. I am almost certain it was not
taken from B., the Prior's.</p>

<p>"The room in the drawing, 'On dangerous ground,' is
imaginary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not believe I entered any of the Gatehouses.</p>

<p>"The resemblance you see in the drawing to the room
in the Deanery Gatehouse (C.), might not be gained by
actual observation of the <i>interior</i>.</p>

<p>"In many instances an artist can well judge what the
interior may be from studying the <i>outside</i>. I only throw
this out to show that the artist may not have seen a thing
even when a strong resemblance occurs. I am sorry to leave
any doubt on the subject, though personally I feel none.</p>

<p>"You see I never felt the necessity or propriety of being
locally accurate to Rochester or its buildings. Dickens, of
course, meant Rochester; yet, at the same time, he chose
to be obscure on that point, and I took my cue from him.
I always thought it was one of his most artistic pieces of
work; the vague, dreamy description of the Cathedral in the
opening chapter of the book. So definite in one sense, yet
so locally vague.</p>

<p>The College Yard Gate (<span class="smcap">a</span>) must therefore be regarded
as the typical Jasper's Gatehouse, but, with the usual novelist's
license, some points in all three Gatehouses have been
utilized for effect. So we can imagine the three friends in
succession going up the "postern stair;" and, further on in
the story, we can picture that mysterious "single buffer, Dick
Datchery, living on his means," as a lodger in the "venerable
architectural and inconvenient" official dwelling of Mr. Tope,
minutely described in the eighteenth chapter of <i>Edwin Drood</i>,
as "communicating by an upper stair with Mr. Jasper's,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
watching the unsuspecting Jasper as he goes to and from
the Cathedral.</p>

<p>Chapters twelve, fourteen, and twenty-three refer to
Jasper's Gatehouse, and its proximity to the busy hum of
human life, in very vivid terms, especially chapter twelve:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Among these secluded nooks there is little stir or movement
after dark. There is little enough in the high tide of the day, but
there is next to none at night. Besides that, the cheerfully frequented
High Street lies nearly parallel to the spot (the old Cathedral rising
between the two), and is the natural channel in which the Cloisterham
traffic flows, a certain awful hush pervades the ancient pile, the
cloisters, and the churchyard after dark, which not many people
care to encounter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One might fancy that the tide of life was
stemmed by Mr. Jasper's own Gatehouse. The murmur of the tide
is heard beyond; but no wave passes the archway, over which his
lamp burns red behind the curtain, as if the building were a
Lighthouse.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"The red light burns steadily all the evening in the Lighthouse on
the margin of the tide of busy life. Softened sounds and hum of
traffic pass it, and flow on irregularly into the lonely precincts; but
very little else goes by save violent rushes of wind. It comes on to
blow a boisterous gale.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. John Jasper's lamp is kindled, and his
Lighthouse is shining, when Mr. Datchery returns alone towards it.
As mariners on a dangerous voyage, approaching an iron-bound
coast, may look along the beams of the warning light to the haven
lying beyond it that may never be reached, so Mr. Datchery's wistful
gaze is directed to this beacon and beyond.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p></div>

<p>The sensation of calm in passing suddenly out of the busy
High Street of Rochester into the subdued precincts of the
Cathedral, as above described, is very marked and peculiar,
and must be experienced to be realized.</p>

<p>Among the many interesting ancient buildings in "the
lonely precincts" may be mentioned the old Episcopal Palace
of the Bishops of Rochester. My friend Mr. George Payne,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
F.S.A., Hon. Sec. of the Kent Arch&aelig;ological Society, who now
lives there, writes me that:&mdash;"it is impossible to say when it
was first built, but it was rebuilt <i>circa</i> 1200, the Palace which
preceded it having been destroyed by fire. Bishop Fisher
was appointed to the See in 1504, and mainly resided at
Rochester. The learned prelate here entertained the great
Erasmus in 1516, and Cardinal Wolsey in 1527. In 1534
Bishop Fisher left Rochester never to return, being beheaded
on Tower Hill, June 22nd, 1535. The front of the Palace has
been coated with rough plaster work dusted over with broken
tile, but the rear walls are in their original state, being wholly
composed of rag, tufa, and here and there Roman tiles. The
cellars are of the most massive construction, and many of the
rooms are panelled."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i_154.png" width="550" height="372" alt="The Vines and Restoration House" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Monks' Vineyard of <i>Edwin Drood</i> exists as "The
Vines," and is one of the "lungs" of Rochester, belonging to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the Dean and Chapter, by whom it is liberally leased to the
Corporation for a nominal consideration. It was a vineyard,
or garden, in the days of the monks, and is now a fine open
space, planted with trees, and has good walks and well-trimmed
lawns and borders. Remains of the wall of the city,
or abbey, previous to the Cathedral, constitute the northern
boundary of "The Vines." There are commodious seats for
the public, and it was doubtless on one of these, as represented
in the illustration <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'entited'">entitled</ins> "Under the Trees," that Edwin
Drood and Rosa sat, during that memorable discussion of
their position and prospects, which began so childlike and
ended so sadly. "'Can't you see a happy Future?' For
certain, neither of them sees a happy Present, as the gate
opens and closes, and one goes in and the other goes away."
A fine clump of old elms (seven in number), called "The
Seven Sisters," stands at the east end of the Vines, nearly
opposite Restoration House, and it was under these trees
that the conversation took place.</p>

<p>So curiously exact at times does the description fit in with
the places, that we notice opposite Eastgate House the
"Lumps of Delight Shop," to which it will be remembered
that after the discussion Rosa Bud directed Edwin Drood to
take her.</p>

<p>Dickens's last visit to Rochester was on Monday, 6th June,
1870, when he walked over from Gad's Hill Place with his
dogs; and he appears to have been noticed by several persons
in the Vines, and particularly by Mr. John Sweet, as he stood
leaning against the wooden palings near Restoration House,
contemplating the beautiful old Manor House. These palings
have since been removed, and an iron fence substituted. The
object of this visit subsequently became apparent, when it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
was found that, in those pages of <i>Edwin Drood</i> written a few
hours before his death, Datchery and the Princess Puffer held
that memorable conference there. "They have arrived at the
entrance to the Monks' Vineyard; an appropriate remembrance,
presenting an exemplary model for imitation, is
revived in the woman's mind by the sight of the place," in
allusion of course to a present of "three shillings and sixpence"
which Edwin Drood gave her Royal Highness on a previous
occasion to buy opium.</p>

<span class="caption">Restoration House, Rochester, as it appeared in Dickens&#39;s time. (From a sketch by an Amateur.)</span>
</div>

<p>The extensive promenade called the Esplanade (where
in 1889 we saw the Regatta in which, after a series of annual
defeats, Rochester maintained its supremacy), on the east
side of the river Medway, under the Castle walls, pleasantly
approached from the Cathedral Close, is memorable as having
been the spot described in the thirteenth chapter where
Edwin and Rosa met for the last time, and mutually agreed
to terminate their unfortunate and ill-assorted engagement.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They walked on by the river. They began to speak of their
separate plans. He would quicken his departure from England, and
she would remain where she was, at least as long as Helena remained.
The poor dear girls should have their disappointment broken to them
gently, and, as the first preliminary, Miss Twinkleton should be
confided in by Rosa, even in advance of the reappearance of Mr.
Grewgious. It should be made clear in all quarters that she and
Edwin were the best of friends. There had never been so serene an
understanding between them since they were first affianced."</p></div>

<p>We are anxious to identify Cloisterham Weir, frequently
mentioned in <i>Edwin Drood</i>, but more particularly as being
the place where Minor Canon Crisparkle found Edwin's watch
and shirt-pin. The Weir, we are told in the novel, "is full
two miles above the spot to which the young men [Edwin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and Neville] had repaired [presumably the Esplanade] to
watch the storm." There is, however, no Weir nearer than
Allington, at which place the tide of the Medway stops, and
Allington is a considerable distance from Rochester, probably
seven or eight miles. How well the good Minor Canon's
propensity for "perpetually pitching himself headforemost into
all the deep water in the surrounding country," and his "pilgrimages
to Cloisterham Weir in the cold rimy mornings,"
are brought into requisition to enable him to obtain the watch
and pin.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He threw off his clothes, he plunged into the icy water, and
swam for the spot&mdash;a corner of the Weir&mdash;where something glistened
which did not move and come over with the glistening water drops,
but remained stationary.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He brought the watch to the bank,
swam to the Weir again, climbed it, and dived off. He knew
every hole and corner of all the depths, and dived and dived and
dived, until he could bear the cold no more. His notion was that he
would find the body; he only found a shirt-pin sticking in some mud
and ooze."</p></div>

<p>Our failure to identify Cloisterham Weir exhibits another
instance where, for the purposes of the story, an imaginary
place is introduced. To Mr. William Ball is due the credit
for subsequently suggesting that Snodland Brook and Snodland
Weir may have possibly been in Dickens's mind in
originating Cloisterham Weir; so we tramped over to inspect
them. Near the village, the brook (or river, for it is
of respectable width) is turbid and shallow, but higher up&mdash;a
mile or so&mdash;we found it clearer and deeper, and we heard
from some labourers, whom we saw regaling themselves by the
side of a hayrick, that a local gentleman had some years ago
been in the habit of bathing in the stream all the year round.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i_159.png" width="550" height="414" alt="St. Nicholas&#39; Burying Ground" title="" />
</div>

<p>The ancient Church of St. Nicholas (1423) is on the north
side of the Cathedral. In front of it is a narrow strip of ground,
enclosed with iron railings, formerly the burial-ground of the
Church, but now disused, referred to in <i>Edwin Drood</i> as "a
fragment of a burial-ground in which an unhappy sheep was
grazing." In this enclosure, which is neatly kept, there
are a weeping willow at each end, and in the centre an
exquisite specimen of the catalpa tree (<i>Catalpa syringifolia</i>),
the floral ornament of the Cathedral precincts. At the
time of our visit it is in perfect condition, the large cordate
bright green leaves, and the massive trusses of labiate flowers
of white, yellow, and purple colours (not unlike those of the
<i>Impatiens noli-me-tangere</i> balsam, only handsomer) are worth
walking miles to see. It is a North American plant, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
its native country sometimes grows to a height of forty feet.
The specimen here described is about twenty feet high, and
was planted about fifteen years ago.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>On the opposite side of the way is the old cemetery of St.
Nicholas' Church, originally part of the Castle moat, but which
was converted to its present purpose about half a century ago.
This quiet resting-place of the dead has intense interest for the
lover of Dickens, as it was here that he desired to be buried;
and his family would certainly have carried his wishes into
effect, but that the place had been closed for years and no
further interments were allowed. Pending other arrangements
at Shorne, an admirable suggestion was made in the <i>Times</i>,
which speedily found favour with the nation in its great
affection for him, namely, that he should rest in Westminster
Abbey; and, the Dean of Westminster promptly and wisely
responding to the suggestion, it was at once carried into effect.</p>

<p>As we pause, and look again and again at the sheltered
nook in the old cemetery sanctified by his memory, and
adorned by rich evergreens and other trees, among which the
weeping willow and the almond are conspicuous, we quite
understand and sympathize with Dickens's love for such a
calm and secluded spot.</p>

<p>The Dean and Chapter of Rochester, it will be recollected,
were anxious that the great novelist's remains should be
placed in or near their Cathedral, and that wish might have
been gratified, except, as just explained, that the public
decreed otherwise. However, they sanctioned the erection,
by the executors, of a brass, which enriches the wall of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
south transept of the edifice, and which has the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>The unfinished novel of <i>Edwin Drood</i>, which, as we have
seen, is so inseparably connected with Rochester Cathedral,
has been <i>finished</i> by at least half a dozen authors, probably to
their own satisfaction; but it is a hard matter to the reader
to struggle through any one of them. However, there is a
little <i>brochure</i> in this direction which we feel may here be
appropriately noticed. It is called, <i>Watched by the Dead:
A Loving Study of Charles Dickens's half-told Tale</i>, 1887, and
was written by R. A. Proctor, F.R.A.S., the Astronomer,
whose untimely death from fever in America was announced
after our return from our week's tramp. The author had
evidently studied the matter both lovingly and attentively,
and starts with the assumption that it is an example of what
he calls "Dickens's favourite theme," which more than any
other had a fascination for him, and was apparently regarded
by him as likely to be most potent in its influence on others.
It was that of "a wrong-doer watched at every turn by one
of whom he has no suspicion, for whom he even entertains a
feeling of contempt," and Mr. Proctor has certainly evolved a
very suggestive and not improbable conclusion to the story.
Instances of Dickens's favourite theme are adduced from
<i>Barnaby Rudge</i>, where Haredale, unsuspected, steadily waits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and watches for Rudge, till, after more than twenty years,
"At last! at last!" he cries, as he captures his brother's
murderer on the very spot where the murder had been committed;
from <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>, where Sampson and
Sally Brass are watched by the Marchioness&mdash;their powerless
victim as they supposed, and by whom their detection is
brought about; from <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, where Ralph Nickleby
is watched by Brooker; and from <i>Dombey and Son</i>, where
Dombey is watched by Carker, and he in turn is watched by
good Mrs. Brown and her unhappy daughter. Instances of
this kind also appear in <i>David Copperfield</i>, <i>Bleak House</i>,
and <i>Little Dorrit</i>.</p>

<p>Reasoning from similar data, Mr. Proctor concludes that
Jasper was watched by Edwin Drood in the person of
Datchery, and thus he was to have been tracked remorselessly
"to his death by the man whom he supposed he had
slain." The <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> as regards the other characters seems
also not improbable. Rosa Bud was to have married Lieutenant
Tartar, and Crisparkle, Helena Landless. Neville was
to have died, but not before he had learned to understand the
change which Edwin's character had undergone. As to
Edwin Drood himself, "purified by trial, strengthened though
saddened by his love for Rosa," Edwin would have been one
of those characters Dickens loved to draw&mdash;a character
entirely changed from a once careless, almost trivial self, to
depth and earnestness. "All were to join in changing the
ways of dear old Grewgious from the sadness and loneliness
of the earlier scenes" in the story, "to the warmth and light
of that kindly domestic life for which, angular though he
thought himself, his true and genial nature fitted him so
thoroughly." This attempt to solve <i>The Mystery of Edwin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Drood</i> will amply repay perusal. It was probably one of the
last works of this very able and versatile author.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It is right to state that Mr. Luke Fildes, R.A., the
illustrator of <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>, with whom we
have had the pleasure of an interview, entirely rejects this
theory. He does not favour the idea that Datchery is Edwin
Drood; his opinion is that the ingenuous and kind-hearted
Edwin, had he been living, would never have allowed his
friend Neville to continue so long under the grave suspicion
of murder. Nay more: he is convinced that Dickens intended
that Edwin Drood should be killed by his uncle; and
this opinion is supported by the fact of the introduction of
a "large black scarf of strong close-woven silk," which
Jasper wears for the first time in the fourteenth chapter of the
story, and which was likely to have been the means of death,
<i>i. e.</i> by strangulation. Mr. Fildes said that Dickens seemed
much surprised when he called his attention to this change of
dress&mdash;very noticeable and embarrassing to an artist who had
studied the character&mdash;and appeared as though he had unintentionally
disclosed the secret. He further stated that it
was Dickens's intention to take him to a condemned cell in
Maidstone or some other gaol, in order "that he might make
a drawing," "and," said Dickens, "do something better than
Cruikshank;" in allusion, of course, to the famous drawing
of "Fagin in the condemned cell." "Surely this," remarked
our informant, "points to our witnessing the condemned
culprit Jasper in his cell before he met his fate."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Fildes spoke with enthusiasm of the very great kindness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and consideration which he received from Dickens, and the
pains he took to introduce his young friend to the visitors at
Gad's Hill, and in London at Hyde Park Place, who were his
seniors. He was under an engagement to visit Dickens,&mdash;had
his portmanteau packed in fact, almost ready to start on his
journey&mdash;when he saw to his amazement the announcement
of his death in the newspapers&mdash;and it was a very great shock
to him. Not long afterwards, Mr. Fildes said, the family,
with much kind thoughtfulness, renewed the invitation to him
to stay a few days at Gad's Hill Place, and during that time
he made the imperishable drawing of "The Empty Chair."</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the above circumstances coming from so
high an authority, a missing link has been supplied, but&mdash;<i>The
Mystery of Edwin Drood</i> is still unsolved!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>RICHARD WATTS'S CHARITY, ROCHESTER.</h3>

<div class="hang2">"Strictly speaking, there were only <i>six</i> Poor Travellers; but being a
Traveller myself, though an idle one, and being withal as poor as I
hope to be, I brought the number up to seven.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I, for one, am
so divided this night between fact and fiction, that I scarce know
which is which."&mdash;<i>The Seven Poor Travellers.</i></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> most unique Charity ever described in fiction, or
founded on fact, well deserves a few pages to be devoted
to a record of its interesting history and present position.
We therefore occupy a short time in examining it on
Thursday morning, before our visit to the Marshes.</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 381px;">
<img src="images/i_166.png" width="381" height="550" alt="The &quot;Six Poor Travellers&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>Except for <i>The Seven Poor Travellers</i>, which was the title
of the Christmas Number of <i>Household Words</i> issued in
1854, it is possible that few beyond "the ancient city" would
ever have heard, or indeed have cared to hear, anything about
the Worshipful Master Richard Watts or his famous Charity;
now, as all the world knows, it is a veritable "household
word" to readers and admirers of Dickens. In the narrative,
he, as the first Traveller, is supposed to have visited Rochester,
and passed the evening with the six Poor Travellers, and
thus to have made the seventh. After hearing the story of
the Charity "from the decent body of a wholesome matronly
presence" (this was Mrs. Cackett, a former matron, who is said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
to have been very much astonished at her appearance in the
drama of <i>The Seven Poor Travellers</i>, which she subsequently
witnessed at the Rochester Theatre), he obtains permission
to treat the Travellers to a hot supper. The inn at which the
first Traveller stayed was doubtless our old acquaintance, the
Bull, "where the window of his adjoining bedroom looked
down into the Inn yard, just where the lights of the kitchen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
redden a massive fragment of the Castle wall." Here was
brewed the "wassail" contained in the "brown beauty," the
"turkey" and "beef" roasted, and the "plum-pudding"
boiled. As Mr. Robert Langton says, "the account of the
treat to the poor Travellers is of course wholly fictitious,
although it is accepted as sober truth by many people, both
in Rochester and elsewhere."</p>

<p>It is not our purpose to criticize the seven pretty stories
which make up this Christmas Number, part of the first of
which only relates to Watts's Charity; but we will venture
to affirm that the concluding portion of that story, referring
to "Richard Doubledick," "who was a Poor Traveller with
not a farthing in his pocket, and who came limping down
on foot to this town of Chatham," is one of the most touching
instances of Christian forgiveness ever recorded, and hardened
indeed must he be who reads it with dry eyes.</p>

<p>To what extent Dickens himself was affected by this beautiful
tale, is shown by the following extract from a letter
addressed by him, on 22nd December, 1854, to the late
Mr. Arthur Ryland, formerly Mayor of Birmingham, now
treasured by his widow, Mrs. Arthur Ryland, who kindly
allowed a copy to be taken:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What you write with so much heartiness of my first Poor
Traveller is quite delightful to me. The idea of that little
story obtained such strong possession of me when it came
into my head, that it cost me more time and tears than most
people would consider likely. The response it meets with is
payment for anything."</p>

<p>It is also interesting to record that many years afterwards
Mr. Ryland read this story at one of the Christmas gatherings
of the Birmingham and Midland Institute, and subsequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
received from an unknown correspondent&mdash;Sergeant A&mdash;&mdash;,
of the 106th Light Infantry, then stationed at Umballa, East
Indies, who had noticed an account of the reading in a newspaper&mdash;a
letter under date of 15th July, 1870, asking to be
favoured with a copy of the story; "for," said the writer,
"we have just started a Penny Reading Society (if I may
call it so), and I'm sure that story would be the means of
reclaiming many men from their vices&mdash;I mean drinking and
low company." The story was of course sent, and Mr.
Ryland subsequently communicated the circumstances to the
present Mr. Charles Dickens, who replied&mdash;"I wish my dear
father could have seen the sergeant's letter; it would have
pleased him, I am sure."</p>

<p>As we proceed along the High Street, on the north side
towards Chatham, a walk of only a few yards from the Bull
brings us to a curious Tudor stone-built house of two stories,
with latticed windows and three-pointed gables. Under a
lamp in the centre, which is over the "quaint old door"&mdash;the
door-sill itself being (as is usual with some old houses) a
little below the street, so that we drop by a step or two
into the entrance-hall&mdash;is a tablet containing the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>

</table></div>







<p>We enter the old-fashioned little parlour, or office, on the
left-hand side, "warm in winter and cool in summer. It has
a look of homely welcome and soothing rest. It has a
remarkably cosy fireside, the very blink of which, gleaming
out into the street upon a winter's night, is enough to warm
all Rochester's heart." The matron receives us politely, and
shows us two large books of foolscap size with ruled columns,
one of these containing a record of the visitors to the Charity,
and the other a list of the recipients thereof. A little
pleasantry is caused by one of us entering his name in the
wrong book, but this mistake is promptly rectified by the
matron, who informs us that we are scarcely objects for relief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
as "Poor Travellers." She then kindly repeats to us the two
legends respecting the origin of the Charity, the first of which
is tolerably well known, but the other is less familiar. Before
recording these, it may be well to give an extract from the
will of Master Richard Watts (a very curious and lengthy
document), which was industriously hunted up by the late
Mr. Charles Bullard, author of the <i>Romance of Rochester</i>,
and by him contributed to the <i>Rochester and Chatham
Journal</i>, of which it fills a whole column.</p>

<p>The will (dated, as previously stated, August 22nd, 1579)
directs, <i>inter alia</i>, that "First the Alms-house already erected
and standing beside the Markett Crosse, within the Citty of
Rochester aforesaid, which Almshouses my Will Purpose
and Desire is that there be reedified added and provided
with such Roomes as be there already provided Six Severall
Roomes with Chimneys for the Comfort placeing and abideing
of the Poore within the said Citty, and alsoe to be made
apt and convenient places therein for Six good Matrices or
Flock Bedds and other good and sufficient Furniture to
harbour or lodge in poore Travellers or Wayfareing Men
being noe Common Rogues nor Proctors, and they the said
Wayfareing Men to harbour and lodge therein noe longer
than one Night unlesse Sickness be the farther Cause thereof
and those poore Folkes there dwelling shall keepe the House
sweete make the Bedds see to the Furniture keepe the same
sweete and courteously intreate the said poore Travellers
and to every of the said poore Travellers att their first comeing
in to have fourpence and they shall warme them at the
Fire of the Residents within the said House if Need be."</p>

<p>The reason for the exception in the testator's will as
regards rogues is sufficiently obvious, and therefore all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
point of this singular bequest lies in the word "Proctors."
Who were they? One of the legends has it that the obsolete
word "Proctors" referred to certain sturdy mendicants who
swarmed in the south of England, and went about extracting
money from the charitable public under the pretence of
collecting "Peter's Pence" for the Pope; or, as the compiler
of Murray's <i>Handbook to the County of Kent</i> suggests, "were
probably the bearers of licences to collect alms for hospitals,"
etc. Possibly the worthy Master Richard Watts
objected to the levying of this blackmail; or he may in his
walks have been subjected to the proctors' importunities, and
consequently in his will rigorously debarred them in all
futurity from any share in his Charity.</p>

<p>The other legend is that Master Watts, being grievously
sick and sore to die, sent for his lawyer, who in those days
acted as proctor as well,&mdash;Steerforth in <i>David Copperfield</i>
calls the proctor "a monkish kind of attorney,"&mdash;and bade
him prepare his will according to certain instructions. The
will was made, but not in the manner directed, and subsequently,
on the testator regaining his health, he discovered
the fraud which the crafty lawyer or proctor had tried to
perpetrate&mdash;which was, in fact, to make himself the sole
legatee. In his just indignation he made another will, and
in it for ever excluded the fraternity of proctors from benefiting
thereby. The reader is at liberty to accept whichever
of the two legends he chooses. It is right to say that Mr.
Roach Smith utterly rejects the second story. He says
proctors were simply rogues, although some of them may
have been licensed.</p>

<p>The following is a foot-note to Fisher's <i>History and
Antiquities of Rochester and its Environs</i>, MDCCLXXII.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>
<img src="images/i_172.png" width="600" height="421" alt="Watts&#39; Almshouses: Rochester" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is generally thought that the reason of Mr. Watts's
excluding proctors from the benefit of the Charity, was that
a proctor had been employed to make his will, whereby he
had given all the estates to himself; but I am inclined to
believe that the word proctor is derived from procurator, who
was an itinerant priest, and had dispensations from the Pope
to absolve the subjects of this realm from the oath of allegiance
to Queen Elizabeth, in whose reign there were many
such priests."</p>

<p>When the identity of Miss Adelaide Anne Procter, the
gifted author of the pure and pathetic <i>Legends and Lyrics</i>
(who had been an anonymous contributor to <i>Household
Words</i> for some time under the <i>nom de plume</i> of "Mary
Berwick"), became known to Charles Dickens, he sent her a
charming and kindly letter of congratulation and appreciation,
dated 17th December, 1854 (just at the time that the
Christmas stories of the <i>Seven Poor Travellers</i> were published),
which thus concludes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have given me so much pleasure, and have made
me shed so many tears, that I can only think of you now in
association with the sentiment and grace of your verses.
Pray accept the blessing and forgiveness of Richard Watts,
<i>though I am afraid you come under both his conditions of
exclusion</i>."</p>

<img src="images/i_174.png" width="400" height="345" alt="Signatures: Charles Dickens and Mark Lemon" title="" />
</div>

<p>We are informed that the original bequest of the testator
was only &pound;36 16<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per annum, being the rent of land;
but now, owing to the improved letting of the land, for
building and other purposes, the Revenues of the Charity are
upwards of &pound;4,000 per annum. The "fourpence" of the
foundation would be equal to some three shillings and fourpence
of our money. The trustees, about sixteen in number,&mdash;one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of whom has filled the office for fifty years&mdash;have
very wisely and prudently obtained an extension of their
powers; and the Court of Chancery have twice (in 1855
and 1886) sanctioned schemes for the administration of the
funds, which have largely benefited Rochester in many ways.
As witness of this, there are a series of excellent almshouses
on the Maidstone Road (which cost about &pound;6,000), with
appropriate entrance-gates and gardens, endowed for the
support and maintenance of townsmen and townswomen.
We subsequently go into several of the rooms, all beautifully
clean, and in most cases tastefully decorated by the inmates
with a few pictures, prints, and flowers, and find that the
present occupants are ten almsmen and six women. We
have a chat with one of the almsmen,&mdash;a hearty old man,
once the beadle of St. Margaret's Church,&mdash;who rejoices in
the name of Peter Weller, and whom we find to be well
up in his <i>Pickwick</i>. There are a resident head-nurse and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
three other resident nurses in the establishment, who occasionally
go out to nurse the sick in the city. In addition to
these almshouses, a handsome new hospital has been erected
in the New Road, and partly endowed (&pound;1,000 a year) out
of the funds. Contributions are also made annually from
the same source towards the support of the Public Baths,
and for apprenticing deserving lads. Such is the development
of this remarkable Charity.</p>

<p>The matron calls our attention to many interesting names
in the Visitors' book. Under date of the 11th May, 1854, are
the signatures, in good bold writing, of Charles Dickens and
Mark Lemon; and in subsequent entries, extending over
many years, appear the names of Wilkie Collins, W. H. Wills,
W. G. Wills, Walter Besant, Thomas Adolphus Trollope,
J. Henry Shorthouse, Augustus J. C. Hare, and other well-known
<i>litt&eacute;rateurs</i>. As usual, there are also numerous names
of Americans, including those of Miss Mary Anderson and
party.</p>

<p>There are many curious remarks recorded in this book,
such as an entry dated 26th June, 1857, which says:&mdash;"Tossed
by, and out of the Bull with a crumpled horn, as no
one would lend me five shillings, therefore obliged to solicit
the benefit of this excellent charity." There is an admirable
testimony in Latin, by the late Bishop of Lincoln, Dr.
Wordsworth, to the usefulness of the institution, which, dated
23rd August, 1883, is as follows:&mdash;"<i>Esto perpetua obstantibus
Caritatis Commissionariis.</i>" His Lordship's remark was
probably in allusion to the fact that the Charity Commissioners
were (as we were afterwards informed) inclined,
some time ago, to abolish the Charity, but this proceeding
was stoutly and successfully resisted by the trustees. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the most gratifying records which we see in the book consist
of several entries by recipients of the Charity themselves, who
have subsequently come again after prosperous times in the
capacity of visitors, and thus testified to the benefits received.
Here is one:&mdash;"Having once enjoyed the Charity, I wish it
a long life."</p>

</div>



<p>A clerk has the responsibility of making a careful selection
of six from the number of applicants, and this appears to be
no light task, inasmuch as the "prescribed number of Poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Travellers are forthcoming every night from year's end to
year's end," and sometimes amount to fifty in a day. In
selecting the persons to be admitted, care is taken that,
unless under special circumstances, the same person be not
admitted for more than one night, and in no case for more
than two consecutive nights. A glance over the register
shows that the names include almost all trades and occupa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>tions;
and, as regards the fact of a great many coming from
Kentish towns, Dartford, Greenwich, Canterbury, Maidstone,
etc., we are informed, in reply to our enquiry, that this is no
criterion of the real residence, because the place where the
traveller last lodged is always entered. The matron told us
a story of a clever attempt to obtain admission by a Poor
Traveller "with a tin whistle and very gentlemanly hands,"
who subsequently turned out to be a reporter from the
<i>Echo</i>, in which paper there afterwards appeared an account
of the Charity, called <i>On Tramp by an Amateur</i>.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;"><a name="gallery" id="gallery"></a>
<img src="images/i_177.png" width="475" height="534" alt="A Dormitory in the &quot;Six Poor Travellers&quot; and Gallery Leading to the Dormitories" title="" />
</div>

<p>We are shown over the premises&mdash;scrupulously neat and
clean&mdash;and observe that there are excellent lavatories with
foot-pans, and a pair of slippers provided for each recipient.
We afterwards see the six Poor Travellers who have had their
supper, and are comfortably smoking their pipes in a snug
room, and we have a pleasant and interesting chat with them.
They are much above the condition of ordinary tramps, and
are lodged in six separate bedrooms, or "dormitories" which
open out of a gallery at the back part of the building,
a very curious structure, remaining just as it was in the
days of Queen Elizabeth. For supper, each man is allowed
half a pound of cooked meat, a pound of bread, and half-a-pint
of porter, and receives fourpence in money on leaving.
It is right to state that we heard complaints in the city
relating to the evil effects of a number of poor travellers
being attracted to the Charity daily, when but a few can
obtain relief.</p>

<span class="caption">Satis House.</span>
</div>

<p>Respecting the Worshipful Master Richard Watts himself
very little is known, except that he was appointed by Queen
Elizabeth in 1560 to be the surveyor and clerk of the works
for the building of Upnor Castle; that he was paymaster to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the Wardens of Rochester Bridge for some years previously;
that he was recorder of Rochester, and represented the city
in Parliament from 1563 to 1571, and that he resided at
"Satis House," which stood on the site of the modern residence
bearing the same name, now occupied by Mrs. Booth,
a little to the south of the Cathedral, but which must not,
however, be confounded with the Satis House of <i>Great
Expectations</i>, this latter, as has been previously explained,
being identical with Restoration House, in Crow Lane.
When Queen Elizabeth visited Rochester in 1573, Watts
had the honour of entertaining Her Majesty there, on the last
day of her residence in "the ancient city"; and to his expressions
of regret at having no better accommodation to
offer, the Queen was pleased generously to reply, "Satis," by
which name the house has ever since been known. Estella,
in <i>Great Expectations</i>, gives another view of the origin of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
name. She says:&mdash;"Its other name was Satis; which is
Greek, or Latin, or Hebrew, or all three&mdash;or all one to me&mdash;for
enough: but it meant more than it said. It meant,
when it was given, that whoever had this house, could want
nothing else. They must have been easily satisfied in those
days, I should think." Archbishop Longley was born there
in 1794.</p>

<p>Over and over again, in the various roads and lanes which
we traverse, in the county famous for "apples, cherries, hops,
and women," we have ample opportunities of verifying the
experience of Dickens, and indeed of many other observers
(including David Copperfield, who met numbers of "ferocious-looking
ruffians"), as to the prevalence of tramps, not all of
whom appear eligible as recipients of Watts's Charity! Our
fraternity seems to be ubiquitous, and had we the purse
of Fortunatus, it would hardly suffice to satisfy their requirements.
What a wonderfully thoughtful, descriptive, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
exhaustive chapter is that on "Tramps" in <i>The Uncommercial
Traveller!</i> We believe Rochester and Strood Hill must
have been in Dickens's mind when he penned it. Every
species and every variety of tramp is herein described,&mdash;The
surly Tramp, The slinking Tramp, The well-spoken
young-man Tramp, The John Anderson Tramp, Squire
Pouncerby's Tramp, The show Tramp, The educated Tramp,
The tramping Soldier, The tramping Sailor, The Tramp
handicraft man, Clock-mending Tramps, Harvest Tramps,
Hopping Tramps and Spectator Tramps&mdash;but perhaps the
most amusing of all is the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The young fellows who trudge along barefoot, five or six together,
their boots slung over their shoulders, their shabby bundles under
their arms, their sticks newly cut from some roadside wood, are not
eminently prepossessing, but are much less objectionable. There is
a tramp-fellowship among them. They pick one another up at
resting stations, and go on in companies. They always go at a fast
swing&mdash;though they generally limp too&mdash;and there is invariably one
of the company who has much ado to keep up with the rest. They
generally talk about horses, and any other means of locomotion than
walking: or, one of the company relates some recent experiences of
the road&mdash;which are always disputes and difficulties. As for example.
So as I'm a standing at the pump in the market, blest if there don't
come up a Beadle, and he ses, 'Mustn't stand here,' he ses. 'Why
not?' I ses. 'No beggars allowed in this town,' he ses. 'Who's a
beggar?' I ses. 'You are,' he ses. 'Who ever see <i>me</i> beg? Did
<i>you?</i>' I ses. 'Then you're a tramp,' he ses. 'I'd rather be that
than a Beadle,' I ses. (The company express great approval.)
'Would you?' he ses to me. 'Yes, I would,' I ses to him. 'Well,'
he ses, 'anyhow, get out of this town.' 'Why, blow your little
town!' I ses, 'who wants to be in it? Wot does your dirty little
town mean by comin' and stickin' itself in the road to anywhere?
Why don't you get a shovel and a barrer, and clear your town out
o' people's way?' (The company expressing the highest approval
and laughing aloud, they all go down the hill.)"</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>It is worthy of consideration, and it is probably more than
a mere coincidence, to observe that some of the reforms
which have been effected in the management of the now
munificent revenues of Richard Watts's Charity were instigated
as a sequence to the appearance of Dickens's
imperishable stories, published under the title of <i>The Seven
Poor Travellers</i>. The Rev. Robert Whiston, with whom we
chatted on the subject, is of opinion that the late Lord
Brougham is entitled to the credit for reforms in this and
other charities.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>AN AFTERNOON AT GAD'S HILL PLACE.</h3>

<div class="hang2">"It was just large enough, and no more; was as pretty within as it was
without, and was perfectly arranged and comfortable."&mdash;<i>Little Dorrit.</i><br /><br /></div>

<div class="hang2">"This has been a happy home.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I love it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."&mdash;<i>The Cricket on the
Hearth.</i></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">A never-to-be-forgotten</span> day was Saturday, the twenty-fifth
of August, 1888, a day remarkable, as were many of the
closing days of the summer of that year, for its bright, sunny,
and cheerful nature. The sky was a deep blue&mdash;usually
described as an Italian sky&mdash;broken only by a few fleecy,
cumulus clouds, which served to bring out more clearly the
rich colour of the background. There was a fine bracing air
coming from the north-west, for which the county of Kent is
famous. Truly an enjoyable day for a holiday! and one
that Dickens himself would have loved to describe. So after
a desultory stroll about the streets of Rochester, one of many
delightful strolls, we make our first outward tramp, and that
of course to Gad's Hill. By the way, much attention has
been devoted to the consideration of the derivation of the
name, "Gad's Hill." It is no doubt a corruption of "God's
Hill," of which there are two so-called places in the county,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and there is also a veritable "God's Hill" a little further
south, in the Isle of Wight.</div>

<span class="caption">Rochester from Strood Hill.</span>
</div>

<p>Crossing Rochester Bridge, we enter the busy town of
Strood, pass through its long thoroughfare, go up the Dover
Road,&mdash;which was the ancient Roman military road afterwards
called Watling Street, until a little above Strood it
turned slightly to the left, passing through what is now
Cobham Park,&mdash;and leave the windmill on Broomhill to the
right. The ground rises gently, the chalk formation being
exposed here and there in disused pits. A portion of the
road higher up is cut through the Thanet sands, which rest
on the chalk. Again and again we stop, and turn to admire
the winding valley of the Medway. As we get more into
the country and leave the town behind, we find the roadsides
still decked with summer flowers, notably the fine dark blue
Canterbury bell&mdash;the nettle-leaved Campanula (<i>Campanula
Trachelium</i>)&mdash;and the exquisite light-blue chicory (<i>Cichorium
Intybus</i>); but the flowers of the latter are so evanescent that,
when gathered, they fade in an hour or two. This beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
starlike-blossomed plant is abundant in many parts of Kent.
We pass on the right the pretty high-standing grounds of Mr.
Hulkes at the "Little Hermitage," and notice the obelisk
further to the right on still higher land, erected about fifty
years ago to the memory of Charles Larkin (a name very
suggestive of "the eldest Miss Larkins") of Rochester,&mdash;"a
parish orator and borough Hampden"&mdash;by his grateful
fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>A walk of less than three miles brings us to the "Sir John
Falstaff"&mdash;"a delightfully old-fashioned roadside inn of the
coaching days, which stands on the north side of the road a
little below 'Gad's Hill Place,' and which no man possessed
of a penny was ever known to pass in warm weather."</p>

<p>Mr. Kitton relates in <i>Dickensiana</i> the following amusing
story of a former waiter at the "Falstaff":&mdash;</p>

<p>"A few days after Dickens's death, an Englishman, deeply
grieved at the event, made a sort of pilgrimage to Gad's Hill&mdash;to
the home of the great novelist. He went into the
famous 'Sir John Falstaff Inn' near at hand, and in the
effusiveness of his honest emotions, he could not avoid taking
the country waiter into his confidence.</p>

<p>"'A great loss this of Mr. Dickens,' said the pilgrim.</p>

<p>"'A very great loss to us, sir,' replied the waiter, shaking
his head; 'he had all his ale sent in from this house!'"</p>

<p>One of the two lime-trees only remains, but the well and
bucket&mdash;as recorded by the <i>Uncommercial Traveller</i> in the
chapter on "Tramps"&mdash;are there still, surrounded by a
protective fence.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>
<img src="images/i_187.png" width="600" height="362" alt="The &quot;Sir John Falstaff&quot; Inn, Gad&#39;s Hill." title="" />
<span class='caption'>The &quot;Sir John Falstaff&quot; Inn, Gad&#39;s Hill.</span></div>

<p>We have but little time to notice the "Falstaff," for our
admiring gaze is presently fixed on Gad's Hill Place itself,
the house in which Dickens resided happily&mdash;albeit trouble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
came to him as to most men&mdash;from the year 1856 till his
death in 1870. Everybody knows the story of how, as a little
boy, he cherished the idea of one day living in this house,
and how that idea was gratified in after-life. It is from
the <i>Uncommercial Traveller</i>, in the chapter on "Travelling
Abroad," and the repetition is never stale. He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"So smooth was the old high road, and so fresh were the horses,
and so fast went I, that it was midway between Gravesend and
Rochester, and the widening river was bearing the ships, white-sailed
or black-smoked, out to sea, when I noticed by the wayside a very
queer small boy.</p>

<p>"'Holloa!' said I to the very queer small boy, 'where do you
live?'</p>

<p>"'At Chatham,' says he.</p>

<p>"'What do you do there?' says I.</p>

<p>"'I go to school,' says he.</p>

<p>"I took him up in a moment, and we went on. Presently, the
very queer small boy says, 'This is Gad's Hill we are coming to,
where Falstaff went out to rob those travellers, and ran away.'</p>

<p>"'You know something about Falstaff, eh?' said I.</p>

<p>"'All about him,' said the very queer small boy. 'I am old (I
am nine), and I read all sorts of books. But <i>do</i> let us stop at the top
of the hill, and look at the house there, if you please!'</p>

<p>"'You admire that house?' said I.</p>

<p>"'Bless you, sir,' said the very queer small boy, 'when I was not
more than half as old as nine, it used to be a treat for me to be
brought to look at it. And now, I am nine, I come by myself to
look at it. And ever since I can recollect, my father, seeing me
so fond of it, has often said to me, 'If you were to be very persevering,
and were to work hard, you might some day come to live
in it.' Though that's impossible!' said the very queer small boy,
drawing a low breath, and now staring at the house out of window
with all his might.</p>

<p>"I was rather amazed to be told this by the very queer small boy;
for that house happens to be <i>my</i> house, and I have reason to believe
that what he said was true."</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Lynn Linton, the celebrated novelist, who resided at
Gad's Hill as a child, has very kindly given us her personal
recollections of it sixty years ago, and of the interesting
circumstances under which Charles Dickens subsequently
purchased the property;&mdash;which will be found at the end of
this chapter.</p>

<p>Before seeking permission to enter the grounds of Gad's
Hill Place, which are surrounded by a high wall, and screened
externally by a row of well-topped lime-trees, we retrace our
steps for a few minutes, in order to refresh ourselves with a
homely luncheon, and what Mr. Richard Swiveller would call
a "modest quencher," at the Sir John Falstaff. It may be
certain that not much time is consumed in this operation.
We then take a good look at the remarkable house opposite,
the object of our pilgrimage, which has been made well
known by countless photographs and engravings. It is a
comfortable, but a not very attractive-looking red-brick house
of two stories, with porch at entrance, partly covered with ivy.
All the front windows, with the exception of the central ones,
are bayed, and there are dormer windows in the roof, which is
surmounted by a bell-turret and vane. What a strange
fascination it has for admirers of Dickens when seen for the
first time! According to Forster, in his <i>Life</i> of the novelist,
the house was built in 1780 by a well-known local character
named James Stevens, who rose to a good position. He was
the father-in-law of the late Professor Henslow, the Botanist,
of Cambridge. Dickens paid for it the sum of &pound;1,790, and the
purchase was completed on Friday, 14th March, 1856. The
present owner is Major Austin F. Budden,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> of the 12th Kent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Artillery Volunteers, who, we find, in the course of subsequent
conversation, had also done good municipal service,
having filled the office of Mayor of Rochester for two years,&mdash;from
1879 to 1881,&mdash;and that he was elected at the early age
of twenty-eight.</p>

<p>We ring the bell at the gate which shuts the house out
from view, and are promptly answered by a pleasant-speaking
housemaid, who takes our cards on a salver, and ushers us
into the library. We are requested to enter our names in the
visitors' book, and this is done with alacrity. We are under
the impression that we shall only be allowed to see the hall
and study, a privilege allowed to any visitor on presentation
of a card; but fortunately for us the courteous owner appears,
and says that, as he has half an hour to spare, he will show
us entirely over the house. He is better than his word, and
we, delighted with the prospect, commence our inspection of
the late home of the great novelist with feelings of singular
pleasure, which are altogether a new sensation. Do any
readers remember, when perusing the Waverley novels in
their youth, a certain longing (as the height of their ambition,
possibly gratified in after-life) to see Abbotsford,
the home of the "Wizard of the North"? <i>That</i> is a feeling
akin to the one which possesses us on the present occasion,
a feeling of veneration almost amounting to awe as we recall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and seem to realize, not only the presence of Charles Dickens
himself, but of the many eminent literary, artistic, and histrionic
characters&mdash;his contemporaries&mdash;who assembled here,
and shared the hospitality of the distinguished owner.
"Dickens penetrates here&mdash;where does not his genial sunshine
penetrate?"</p>

<p>Turning over the leaves of the visitors' book, Major Budden
calls our attention to the signatures of Americans, who
constitute by far the majority of visitors. Among the more
recent appears the name of that accomplished actress, Miss
Mary Anderson&mdash;herself a great admirer of Charles Dickens&mdash;who
came accompanied by a party of friends. We also
found her name, with the same party, in the visitors' book at
Richard Watts's Charity in Rochester. Major Budden spoke
also of the great enthusiasm always exhibited by our American
friends in regard to Dickens, some of whom had told him
more than once that it was the custom to instruct their
children in a knowledge of his works: they read them, in
fact, in the schools.</p>

<p>The library, or study, is a very cosy little room, made famous
by Mr. Luke Fildes's picture of "The Empty Chair." It is
situated on the west side of the porch, looking to the front,
with the shrubbery in the distance; and among the most
conspicuous objects contained in it are the curious counterfeit
book-backs devised by Dickens and his friends, and
arranged as shelves to fit the door of the room. They
number nearly eighty, and a selection is given below of a
few of the quaintest titles, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Quarrelly Review. 4 vols.</p>

<p>King Henry the Eighth's Evidences of Christianity. 5 vols.</p>

<p>Noah's Arkitecture. 2 vols.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Chickweed.</p>

<p>Groundsel (by the Author of Chickweed).</p>

<p>Cockatoo on Perch.</p>

<p>History of a Short Chancery Suit. 21 vols.</p>

<p>Cats' Lives. 9 vols.</p>

<p>Hansard's Guide to Refreshing Sleep (many volumes).</p>

<p>The Wisdom of our Ancestors&mdash;I. Ignorance. II. Superstition.
III. The Block. IV. The Stake. V. The Rack.
VI. Dirt. VII. Disease.</p>

<p>Several of the titles were used for a similar purpose at
Tavistock House, London&mdash;Dickens's former residence.</p>

<p>We cannot help, as we sit down quietly for a few minutes,
wondering how much of <i>Little Dorrit</i>, <i>Hunted Down</i>, <i>A Tale
of Two Cities</i>, <i>Great Expectations</i>, <i>The Uncommercial Traveller</i>,
<i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, and <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i> (which
were all issued between 1856 and 1870) was written in this
famous room, to say nothing of those heaps of exquisite
letters which so helped, cheered, interested, or amused many
a correspondent, and have delighted the public since.</p>

<p>In the hall, which has the famous parquet floor laid down
by Dickens, is still hanging the framed illumination, artistically
executed by Owen Jones, and placed there immediately
after Dickens became the "Kentish freeholder on his native
heath" as he called it. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>

<p>"But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning by four o'clock
early at Gad's Hill. There are pilgrims going to Canterbury
with rich offerings, and traders riding to London with fat
purses; I have vizards for you all; you have horses for
yourselves."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<p>From the hall we enter the dining-room, a cheerful apartment
looking on to the beautiful lawn at the back, which has
at the end the arched conservatory of lilac-tinted glass at top,
in which the novelist took so much interest, and where he
hung some Chinese lanterns, sent down from London the day
before his death. We are informed that in this building he
signed the last cheque which he drew, to pay his subscription
to the Higham Cricket Club. The door of the dining-room
is faced with looking-glass, so that it may reflect the contents
of the conservatory. Among these are two or three New
Zealand tree-ferns which Dickens himself purchased. In the
dining-room Major Budden pointed out the exact spot where
the fatal seizure from effusion on the brain took place, on the
afternoon of Wednesday, 8th June, 1870, and where Dickens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
lay: first on the floor to the right of the door on entering,
and afterwards to the left, when the couch was brought down
(by order of Mr. Steele, the surgeon of Strood, as we subsequently
learned), upon which he breathed his last.</p>

<p>The drawing-room faces the front, and, like the dining-room,
has been lengthened, and opens into the conservatory.
In fact, Dickens was always improving Gad's Hill Place.
There is a memorable reference to the conservatory by
Forster in the third vol. of the <i>Life</i>. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This last addition had long been an object of desire with
him, though he would hardly, even now, have given himself
the indulgence but for the golden shower from America.
He saw it first in a completed state on the Sunday before his
death, when his youngest daughter was on a visit to him.</p>

<p>"'Well, Katey,' he said to her, 'now you see <span class="smcap">positively</span>
the last improvement at Gad's Hill,' and every one laughed
at the joke against himself. The success of the new conservatory
was unquestionable. It was the remark of all
around him, that he was certainly, from this last of his
improvements, drawing more enjoyment than from any of its
predecessors, when the scene for ever closed!"</p>

<p>This room is a long one, and, in common with all the
others, gives us, under the auspices of the brilliantly fine
day, some idea of the late owner's love of light, air, and
cheerfulness. That the situation is also a healthy and
bracing one is confirmed by the fact, that in a letter written
on board the <i>Russia</i>, bound for Liverpool, on the 26th April,
1868, after his second American tour, he speaks of having
made a "Gad's Hill breakfast."</p>

<p>Our most considerate cicerone next takes us into several
of the bedrooms, these being of large size, and having a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
dressing-room marked off with a partition, head-high, so that
no cubic space is lost to the main chamber. As illustrative
of Charles Dickens's care for the comfort of his friends, it is
said that in the visitors' bedrooms there was always hot
water and a little tea-table set out, so that each one could
at any time make for himself a cup of the beverage "that
cheers but not inebriates." The views from these rooms are
very charming. Mr. W. T. Wildish afterwards told us, that
during the novelist's life-time, Mr. Trood, the landlord of
the Sir John Falstaff, once took him over Gad's Hill Place,
and he was surprised to find Dickens's own bath-room covered
with cuttings from <i>Punch</i> and other comic papers. I have
since learned that this was a screen of engravings which had
originally been given him.</p>

<p>The gardens, both flower and vegetable, are then pointed
out&mdash;the approach thereto from the back lawn being by
means of a flight of steps&mdash;as also the rosary, which occupies
a portion of the front lawn to the westward. The roses are
of course past their best, but the trees look very healthy.</p>

<p>In the flower garden we are especially reminded of
Dickens's love for flowers, the China-asters, single dahlias,
and zinnias being of exceptional brightness. As to the
violets, which are here in abundance, both the Neapolitan
and Russian varieties, the Major shows us a method of
cultivating them, first in frames, and then in single rows, so
that he can get them in bloom for nearly nine months in
the year!</p>

<p>Adjoining the lawn and vegetable garden is "the much-coveted
meadow," which the master of Gad's Hill obtained by
exchange of some land with the trustees of Sir Joseph
Williamson's Mathematical School at Rochester, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
which he planted "a number of limes and chestnuts, and
other quick-growing trees." Four grass walks meet in the
centre of the vegetable garden, where there is a fine old
mulberry tree.</p>

<p>It is stated in Forster's <i>Life</i> of the novelist (Vol. iii.
p. 188) that Dickens obtained the meadow by exchange of
some land "with the Trustees of Watts's Charity." But this
is not right. The distinguished historian of the Commonwealth,
and the faithful friend of the novelist all through
his life, is so habitually accurate, that it is an exceptional
circumstance for any one to be able to correct him. However,
I am indebted to Mr. A. A. Arnold, of Rochester, for the
following authentic account of the transaction.</p>

<p>Dickens was always anxious to obtain this meadow (which
consists of about fourteen acres), and, believing that the
Trustees of Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School
at Rochester were not empowered to sell their land, he
purchased a field at the back of his own shrubbery from
Mr. Brooker, of Higham, with a view&mdash;as appears from the
following characteristically courteous and business-like letter&mdash;to
effect an exchange.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>"Reverting to a proposal already made in general
terms by my solicitor, Mr. Ouvry, of Lincoln's Inn Fields,

<p>"I believe it will appear to you, on inquiry, that the land
I offer in exchange for the meadow is very advantageously
situated, and is of greater extent than the meadow, and
would be of greater value to the Institution, whose interests
you represent. On the other hand, the acquisition of the
meadow as a freehold would render my little property
more compact and complete.</p>

<p>The offer fell through at the time; but it was renewed in
1868 in a different form, and eventually the field was sold
(by permission of the Charity Commissioners) to Charles
Dickens at an "accommodation" price&mdash;&pound;2,500&mdash;which really
exceeded its actual market value.</p>

</div>

<p>But to resume our inspection. The whole of the back
of the house, looking southward, is covered by a Virginia
creeper (<i>Ampelopsis quinquefolia</i>) of profuse growth, which
must be an object of singular beauty in the autumn when
the crimson tints appear. As it now stands it is beautifully
green, and there is scarcely more than a leaf or two here
and there marking autumnal decay. The two famous
hawthorn trees were blown down in a gale some years
ago.</p>

<p>In a quiet corner under a rose-tree (<i>Gloire de Dijon</i>),

of deep blue lobelia, is a touching little memorial to a
favourite canary. This consists of a narrow little board,
made like a head-stone, and set aslant, on which is painted
in neat letters the following epitaph:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'><br /><br />

DICK,<br />
the best of birds,<br />

<i>Midsummer</i>, 1851,<br />
died<br />
<span class="smcap">at Gad's Hill Place</span>,<br />
<i>4th October, 1866</i>.<br />
</div>

<p>No one can doubt who was the author of these simple lines.
"Dick," it should be said, "was very dear both to Dickens
and his eldest daughter," and he has been immortalized in
Forster's <i>Life</i>. There is a very humorous account given of
the attacks which the cats in the neighbourhood made upon
him, and which were frustrated by an organized defence.
The following is the passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Soon after the arrival of Dickens and his family at Gad's
Hill Place, a household war broke out, in which the commander-in-chief
was his man French, the bulk of the forces
engaged being his children, and the invaders two cats."
Writing to Forster, Dickens says:&mdash;"'The only thing new
in this garden is that war is raging against two particularly
tigerish and fearful cats (from the mill, I suppose), which are
always glaring in dark corners after our wonderful little
Dick. Keeping the house open at all points, it is impossible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
to shut them out, and they hide themselves in the most
terrific manner: hanging themselves up behind draperies, like
bats, and tumbling out in the dead of night with frightful
caterwaulings. Hereupon French borrows Beaucourt's gun,
loads the same to the muzzle, discharges it twice in vain,
and throws himself over with the recoil, exactly like a
clown.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. About four pounds of powder and half a ton
of shot have been fired off at the cat (and the public in
general) during the week. The funniest thing is, that immediately
after I have heard the noble sportsman blazing away at
her in the garden in front, I look out of my room door into
the drawing-room, and am pretty sure to see her coming in
after the birds, in the calmest manner possible, by the back
window.'"</p>

<p>Passing on our way the large and well-lighted servants'
hall, over which is the bachelors' room,&mdash;whence in days gone
by that rare literary serial, <i>The Gad's Hill Gazette</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> issued from
a little printing press, presented by a friend to the sixth son
of the novelist, who encouraged his boy's literary tastes,&mdash;we
next see the stables, as usual, like everything else, in
excellent order. A small statue of Fame blowing her golden
trumpet surmounts the bachelors' room, and looks down upon
us encouragingly.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>
<p>Our attention is then turned to the well, which is stated
to be two hundred and seventeen feet deep, in the shed, or
pumping-room, over which is the Major's mare, "Tell-tale,"
cheerfully doing her daily twenty minutes' task of drawing
water, which is pumped up to the cistern on the roof for the
supply of the house. There is said to be never less than
twenty feet of water in the well.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_204.png" width="500" height="366" alt="The Well at Gad&#39;s Hill Place" title="" />
</div>

<p>It may be interesting to mention that Gad's Hill Place
("the title of my estate, sir, my place down in Kent"), which
is in the parish of Higham, and about twenty-six miles from
London, stands on an elevation two hundred and fifty feet
above mean sea-level. The house itself is built on a bed
of the Thanet sands. The well is bored right through these
sands, which Mr. W. H. Whitaker, F.R.S., of H. M. Geological
Survey (who has kindly given me some valuable
information on the subject), states "may be about forty feet
thick, and the water is drawn up from the bed of chalk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
beneath. This bed is of great thickness, probably six
hundred or seven hundred feet, and the well simply reaches
the level at which the chalk is charged with water, <i>i. e.</i> something
a little higher than the level of the neighbouring river."
The chalk is exposed on the lower bases of Gad's Hill, such
as the Railway Station at Higham, the village of Chalk, the
town of Strood, etc.</p>

<p>There are humorous extracts from letters by Dickens in
Forster's <i>Life</i> respecting the well, which may appropriately
be introduced. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are still (6th of July) boring for water here, at the
rate of two pounds per day for wages. The men seem to
like it very much, and to be perfectly comfortable.".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And
again, "Here are six men perpetually going up and down the
well (I know that somebody will be killed), in the course of
fitting a pump; which is quite a railway terminus&mdash;it is so
iron, and so big. The process is much more like putting
Oxford Street endwise, and laying gas along it, than anything
else. By the time it is finished, the cost of this water
will be something absolutely frightful. But of course it
proportionately increases the value of the property, and
that's my only comfort.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Five men have been looking
attentively at the pump for a week, and (I should hope) may
begin to fit it in the course of October." The depression
caused by the prospect of the "absolutely frightful" cost of
the water seems to have continued to the end of the letter, for
it thus concludes:&mdash;"The horse has gone lame from a sprain,
the big dog has run a tenpenny nail into one of his hind feet,
the bolts have all flown out of the basket carriage, and the
gardener says all the fruit trees want replacing with new
ones."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">The Porch, Gad&#39;s Hill Place.</span>
</div>

<p>Two of the Major's dogs are chained in the places
formerly occupied by Dickens's dogs, "Linda" and "Turk."
The chains are very long, and allow the animals plenty of
room for exercise. The space between the two permitted a
person to walk past without their being able to come near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
him; and, as an instance of Dickens's thoughtful kindliness
even to the lower animals, two holes were made in the wall so
that the dogs could get through in hot weather, and lie in the
shade of the trees on the other side. On the back gate entering
into the lane at the side of the house was painted,
"Beware of the dogs!" This caution appears to have been
very necessary, for we heard more than once the story of an
intrusive tramp who trespassed, and going too near the dogs,
got sadly mauled. Dickens, with characteristic goodness,
sent him at once to Chatham Hospital, and otherwise healed
his wounds.</p>

<p>We are next conducted round the grounds, and have an
opportunity of examining the front of the house more in
detail. The porch is flanked by two cosy seats, the pretty
little spade-shaped shields, and lateral angular ornamental
supports on the back of which, we are informed, were constructed
of pieces of wood from Shakespeare's furniture given
to Dickens by a friend. A large variegated holly grows on
either side of the porch, and a semi-circular gravel walk leads
to the door. There is a closely-cut lawn in front, and opposite
the hollies are two fine specimens of <i>Aucuba Japonica</i>&mdash;the
so-called variegated laurel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>
<img src="images/i_208.png" width="500" height="382" alt="The Cedars, Gad&#39;s Hill." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Cedars, Gad&#39;s Hill.</span>
</div>

<p>It will be remembered that the master of Gad's Hill had a
tunnel excavated under the Dover Road (which runs through
the property), so as to approach the "shrubbery" previously
referred to, without having to cross the open public road. We
did not learn who constructed the tunnel, but it was designed
either by his brother, Mr. Alfred L. Dickens, who died at
Manchester in 1860, or by his brother-in-law, Mr. Henry
Austin. The entrance to the tunnel is by a flight of about
twenty steps, flanked by two beautifully-grown specimens of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
<i>Cedrus deodara</i>, the "deodar," or god-tree of the Himalayas.
The tunnel itself is cut through the sands, and, being only a
little longer than the width of the road, it is not at all dark,
but very pleasant and cool on a hot day. A corresponding
flight of steps leads us into the shrubbery, which is shut
off from the main road by iron railings only. Both ends
of the tunnel are covered with ivy, which has the effect of
partially concealing the openings. Readers of Forster's
<i>Life</i> will recollect that the Swiss ch&acirc;let presented to
Dickens by his friend Fechter the actor, and in which he
spent his last afternoon, formerly stood in the shrubbery.
The ch&acirc;let now stands in the terrace-garden of Cobham
Hall.</p>

<p>Before we reach the exact place we have an opportunity
of examining the two stately cedar trees (<i>Cedrus Libani</i>)
which are the arboreal gems of the place. Major Budden
informs us that they are about one hundred and twenty-eight
years old, and were planted in their present position
when they had attained about twenty years' growth. Some
idea of their luxuriance may be formed when it is mentioned
that the girth of each tree exceeds sixteen feet, and the longest
branch of one of them measures eighty-four feet in length.
In consequence of the habit of these trees "fastigiating" at
the base, a very numerous series of lateral ramifying branches
is the result. These branches spread out in terraces, and the
rich green foliage, covered with exudations of resin, seems as
though powdered silver had been lightly dusted over it.
Each tree extends over a circular area of about eighty feet
of ground in diameter. Under one of the cedars is the
grave of "the big and beautiful Linda," Dickens's favourite
St. Bernard dog. One of the trees has been injured, a large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
branch over-weighted with snow having broken off some
years ago.</p>

<p>Two or three noble ash trees also grace this spot, running
straight up in a column some thirty-five feet before shooting
out a canopy of branches and leaves. There are also a few
Scotch firs, the trunks well covered with ivy, and a pretty
specimen of the variegated sycamore. The undergrowth of
laurel, laurustinus, briar, privet, holly, etc., is very luxuriant
here, and the vacant ground is closely covered with the wood
anemone (<i>Anemone nemorosa</i>), which must form a continuous
mass of pearly white flowers in spring-time.</p>

<p>The ground formerly occupied by the ch&acirc;let is pointed
out to us, its site being marked by a bed of rich scarlet
nasturtiums. It will be recollected that Dickens describes the
interior of the building in a letter to an American friend,
which is thus recorded in Forster's <i>Life:</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Divers birds sing here all day, and the nightingales all
night. The place is lovely and in perfect order.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have put
five mirrors in the ch&acirc;let where I write, and they reflect and
refract, in all kinds of ways, the leaves that are quivering at
the windows, and the great fields of waving corn, and the
sail-dotted river. My room is up among the branches of
the trees; and the birds and the butterflies fly in and out,
and the green branches shoot in at the open windows, and
the lights and shadows of the clouds come and go with
the rest of the company. The scent of the flowers, and
indeed of everything that is growing for miles and miles, is
most delicious."</p>

<p>But the glory of Gad's Hill Place is reserved for us until
the close of our visit, when Major Budden very kindly takes
us up to the roof, which is approached by a commodious flight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of steps; and here, on this exceptionally fine day, we are
privileged to behold a prospect of surpassing beauty. Right
away to the westward is the great Metropolis, its presence
being marked by the usual pall of greyish smoke. Opening
from the town, and becoming wider and wider as the noble
river approaches its estuary, is the Thames, now conspicuous
by numerous vessels, showing masts and white
and brown sails, and here and there by the smoky track
of a steamer.</p>

<p>We remember how often the city and the river have been
the scene of many and many an exploit in Dickens's novels.
Northward are the dreary marshes, the famous "meshes" of
<i>Great Expectations</i>, hereafter to be noticed. Then far to
the eastward runs the valley of the Medway, the picturesque
city of Rochester thereon being crowned by those conspicuous
landmarks, its magnificent Castle and ancient Cathedral. In
the background is the busy town of Chatham, its heights being
capped by an enormous square and lofty building erected
by the sect called "Jezreelites," whatever that may be. We
were informed that the so-called "immortal" leader had
just died, and it has since been reported that the gloomy
building is likely to be converted into a huge jam factory.
Beyond, and nearly seven miles off, is the high land
called "Blue Bell," about three hundred feet above mean
sea-level, and all along to the south the undulating grounds
and beautiful woodland scenery of Cobham Park complete
the picture.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>
<img src="images/i_212.png" width="600" height="382" alt="View from the Roof of Dickens&#39;s House at Gad&#39;s Hill" title="" />
</div>

<p>As Major Budden points out in detail these many natural
beauties of the district, we can quite understand and sympathize
with Dickens's love for this exquisite spot; and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
heartily congratulate the present owner of Gad's Hill Place
on the charming historical property which he possesses, and
which, so far as we can perceive (all honour to him), is
kept in the same excellent condition that characterized it
during the novelist's lifetime. What is particularly striking
about it is at once its compactness, completeness, and
unpretentiousness.</p>

<p>Descending to the library, whence we started nearly three
hours previously, we refresh ourselves with a glass of water
from the celebrated deep well&mdash;a draught deliciously cool
and clear&mdash;which the hospitable Major presses us to "dilute"
(as Professor Huxley has somewhere said) in any way we
please, but which we prefer to drink, as Dickens himself
drank it&mdash;pure. Before we rise to leave the spot we have so
long wished to see, and which we have now gone over to our
hearts' content, we sadly recall to memory for a moment the
"last scene of all that ends this strange, eventful history,"&mdash;that
tragic incident which occurred on Thursday, 9th June,
1870, when there was an "empty chair" at Gad's Hill Place,
and all intelligent English-speaking nations experienced a
personal sorrow.</p>

<p>And so with many grateful acknowledgments to our kind
and courteous host, who gives us some nice flowers and
cuttings as a parting souvenir, we take our leave, having
derived from our bright sunny visit to Gad's Hill Place that
"wave of pleasure" which Mr. Herbert Spencer describes as
"raising the rate of respiration,&mdash;raised respiration being
an index of raised vital activities in general." In fine, the
impression left on our minds is such as to induce us to
feel that we understand and appreciate more of Dickens's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
old home than any illustration or written description of it,
however excellent, had hitherto adequately conveyed to us.
We have seen it for ourselves.</p>

<p>The reminiscences which follow are from Mrs. Lynn
Linton and three of Charles Dickens's nearest neighbours.</p>


<div class='center'><br />GAD'S HILL SIXTY YEARS AGO.</div>

<p>The early love which Charles Dickens felt for Gad's Hill
House, and his boyish ambition to be one day its owner, had
been already anticipated by my father. As a boy and young
man, my father's heart was set on this place; and when my
grandfather's death put him in sufficient funds he bought it.
Being a beneficed clergyman, both of whose livings were in
the extreme north of England, he could not live in the house;
but he kept it empty for many years, always hoping to get
leave of absence from the Bishop for a term long enough to
justify the removal of his large family from Keswick to
Rochester. In 1831 a five years' leave of absence was
granted; and we all came up by coach to this Mecca of
my father's love. We were three days and three nights on
the road; and I remember quite distinctly the square courtyard
and outside balcony of the old Belle Sauvage Inn,
where we put up on our arrival in London. I remember,
too, the powerful scent of the Portugal laurel and the bay-tree
which grew on the right-hand side of Gad's Hill House as
we entered&mdash;brought out by the warm damp of the late
autumn afternoon. In our time all the outhouses had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
leaden figures on the top. There was a cupola with an
alarm bell, which one night was rung lustily, to the terror
of the whole neighbourhood, and the ashamed discovery
among ourselves that rats were not burglars. In the shrubbery
were two large leaden figures of Pomona and Vertumnus,
standing on each side of the walk leading up to the arbour.
We had then two arbours&mdash;one opposite the house at the
end of the green walk, and another in a dilapidated state
further in the shrubbery. They were built of big flint stones,
many of which had holes in them, where small birds made
their nests. I remember in one was a tomtit which was
quite tame, and used to fly in and out while we were watching
it. The two cedars, which I believe are still there, were a
little choked and overshadowed by a large oak-tree, which
my father cut down. Between seventy and eighty coaches,
"vans," and mail-carts passed our house during the day,
besides private carriages, specially those of travellers posting
to or from Dover. Regiments, too, often passed on their
way to Gravesend, where they embarked for India; and
ships' companies, paid off, rowdy and half-tipsy, made the
road really dangerous for the time being. We used to lock
the two gates when we heard them coming, shouting and
singing up the hill; and we had to stand many a mimic
siege from the blue-jackets trying to force their way in.
Sweet-water grapes grew and ripened in the open air over
the wash-house; and the back of the house was covered with
a singularly fine and luscious jargonelle pear. The garden
was rich in apples. We had many kinds, from the sweet
and pulpy nonsuch, to the small tight little pearmain and
lemon pippin. We had nonpareils, golden pippins, brown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and golden russets, Ribstone pippins, and what we called a
port-wine apple&mdash;the flesh red, like that of the "blood-oranges."
The small orchard to the right was as rich in
cherry-trees, filberts, and cobnuts. In the garden we had a
fig-tree, and the mulberry-tree, which is still there, was in
full bearing in our time. The garden altogether was wonderfully
prolific in flowers as well as fruits&mdash;roses as well as
strawberries and apples; and the green-house was full of
grapes. Nightingales sang in the trees near the house, and
the shrubbery was full of song birds. We had a grand view
from the leads, where we used sometimes to go, and whence
I remember seeing a farmyard fire over at Higham&mdash;which
fire they said had been caused by an incendiary. There
was a Low Church clergyman in the neighbourhood who
might have been Chadband or Stiggins. He was fond of
some girls we knew, and called them his "lambs." He used
to put his arm round their waists, and they sat on his knees
quite naturally. I myself heard him preach at Shorne
against the institution of pancakes on Shrove Tuesday. He
said it was not only superstitious but irreligious; as pancakes
meant "pan Kakon," all evil. This I, then a girl of thirteen
or so, heard and remember. When my father died his
property had to be sold, as he did not make an eldest son.
Mr. W. H. Wills, the trusty friend of Charles Dickens, and
editor of <i>Household Words</i> and <i>All The Year Round</i>, was
also a friend of mine. We met at a dinner, and he spoke
to me about Gad's Hill, but as if he wanted to buy it for
himself. He was afraid to mention Charles Dickens's name,
lest we should ask too much. So he told me afterwards. I
had been left executrix under my father's will, being then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the only unmarried daughter; and I took the news to our
solicitor and co-executor, Mr. Loaden. He wrote to Mr.
Wills, and the sale was effected. We scored a little triumph
over the "ornamental timber." Mr. Dickens objected to our
price; the case was submitted to an arbitrator, and we got
more than we originally asked. But there was never one
moment of pique on either side, nor a drop of bad blood as
the consequence. It was always a matter for a laugh and a
joke between Mr. Wills and myself. When we first went
to Gad's Hill there was a fish-pond at the back; but my
father had it filled up, lest one of his adventurous little ones
should tumble in. Officers used to come up from Chatham
to the Falstaff, and have pigeon matches in our big field; and
one of the sights which used to delight our young eyes, was
the gallant bearing and gay uniforms of the Commandant
at Chatham, when he and his staff rode by. We were great
walkers in those days, and used to ramble over Cobham
Park, and round by Shorne, and down to the dreary marshes
beyond Higham. But this was not a favourite walk with us,
and we girls never went there alone. The banks on the
Rochester road&mdash;past Davies's Straits&mdash;were full of sweet
violets, white and purple; and the fungi, lichens, flowers, and
ferns about Shorne and Cobham yet linger in my memory
as things of rarest beauty. We always thought that the
coachman, "Old Chumley," as he was called, was old Weller.
He was a fine, cheery, trustworthy man; and once when my
father was in London, he had one of my sisters and myself&mdash;girls
then about fifteen and thirteen&mdash;put under his charge to
be delivered to him at the end of the journey. The dear old
fellow took as much care of us as if he had been our father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
himself. I remember my brothers gave him a new whip, and
he was very fond of us all.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* We had at a subsequent visit to Gad's Hill
Place, on the invitation of our hospitable friends, Major and
Mrs. Budden, the pleasure of a long and interesting conversation
with Mr. James Hulkes, J.P., of the Little Hermitage,
Frindsbury, a Kentish man, who came to live here more than
sixty years ago, and who was thus a very near neighbour
of Charles Dickens during the whole of the time that he
resided at Gad's Hill Place. We were shown into a delightful
room at the back of the house, overlooking the shrubberies
of the mansion&mdash;in the distance appearing the high ground
on which stands the monument to Charles Larkin. The room
is a happy combination of part workshop, with a fine lathe
and assortment of tools fitted round it&mdash;part study, with a
nice collection of books, engravings and pictures (some of
hunting scenes) on the walls&mdash;and part naturalist's den, with
cases of stuffed birds and animals, guns and fishing-rods&mdash;the
fragrant odour of tobacco breathing friendly welcome to
a visitor of smoking proclivities. The varied tastes of the
owner were sufficiently apparent, and a long chat of over two
hours seemed to us but a few minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. Hulkes said he just remembered the road from Strood
to Gad's Hill being cut through the sands down to the chalk.
It was for some time afterwards called "Davies's Straits,"
after the Rev. George Davies, the then Chairman of the
Turnpike Road Board, and the term indicated the difficulty
and expense of the operation. Before the new road was cut,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the old highway constituting this part of the Dover Road
was very hilly and dangerous.</p>

<p>Reverting to the subject of Charles Dickens, our relator
remarked, "I fear I cannot be of much use to you by giving
information about Mr. Dickens, as I only knew him as a
kind friend, a very genial host, and a most charming
companion; to the poor he was always kind&mdash;a deserving
beggar never went from his house unrelieved." What indeed
could be said more! These few simple words, spoken so
earnestly after a period of nearly twenty years, sufficed to
bring before us the lost neighbour whose memory was so
warmly cherished by his surviving friend.</p>

<p>John Forster, in the <i>Life</i>, speaks of Mr. Hulkes as being
"one of the two nearest country neighbours with whom the
[Dickens] family had become very intimate," and mentions
that both Mr. and Mrs. Hulkes were present at the wedding of
the novelist's second daughter, Kate, with Mr. Charles Alston
Collins. Mr. Hulkes spoke of the pleasant parties at Gad's
Hill Place, at which he met Mr. Forster, Mr. Wilkie Collins,
Mr. Percy Fitzgerald, Mr. Marcus Stone, Mr. H. F. Chorley,
and many others; and observed that, on the occasion of
charades and private theatricals there, Charles Dickens was
always in fine form. He showed us an original manuscript
programme (of which we were allowed to take a copy),
written on half-a-sheet of foolscap; and from the fact that
"<i>Gads Hill Gazette</i> Printing Office" appears in the corner
it would seem that it was printed on the occasion for the
guests. It is as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The various parts were taken by Dickens and his family,
and the entire word of the last Charade is supposed to be
"May Day."</p>

<p>In connection with charades, Mr. Hulkes alluded to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Dickens's remarkable facility for "guessing a subject fixed
on when he was out of the room, in half a dozen questions;"
and related the story of how at the young people's game of
"Yes and No," he found out the proper answer to a random
question fixed upon by Mr. Charles Collins, one of the
company, in his absence, which was, "The top-boot of the
left leg of the head post-boy at Newman's Yard, London."
The squire sometimes took a stroll with his neighbour, but
observed "he was too fast a walker for me&mdash;I couldn't keep
up with him!"</p>

<p>Mr. Hulkes possesses a nearly complete "file" (from 1862
to 1866) of the <i>Gad's Hill Gazette</i>, to which he was one of the
subscribers, and which was edited by the novelist's son, Mr.
Henry Fielding Dickens, and, as before stated, printed at
Gad's Hill Place. It chronicled the arrivals and departures,
the results of cricket matches and billiard games, with
interesting gossip of events relating to the family and the
neighbourhood. Occasionally there was a leading article,
and now and then an acrostic appeared. Among the subscribers
were the novelist and his family, The Lord Chief
Justice, The Dean of Bristol, Lady Molesworth, Mrs. Milner
Gibson, M. Stone, A. Halliday, J. Hulkes, C. Kent, W. H.
Wills, H. F. Chorley, Edmund Yates, etc. The number for
January 20th, 1866, contains a humorous correspondence on
the management of the journal between "Jabez Skinner" and
"Blackbury Jones." Mr. H. F. Dickens kindly allows a copy
of the number for December 30th, 1865, to be reproduced,
which is interesting as giving an account of the Staplehurst
accident, and also the notice issued when the journal was
discontinued.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[<a href="images/i_p_199.png">199</a>]</span></p>

In the circulars, we announced that

<div class='center'>Christmas at Gad's Hill.</div>

&nbsp;During the past week, Gad's Hill has resounded
with the sounds of festivity and merriment.<br />

<div class='right'>
(Continued on the next page)<br /></div></div>
<div class='center'>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[<a href="images/i_p_200.png">200</a>]</span></p>

<div class='bigger'>&nbsp;As is usually the case, the house has
been filled with the guests who have
come to taste of Mr Dickens' hospitality.
These consisted of Mr Mad, and
Master Fechter, Mr &amp; Mrs C. Collins, Mr
Mrs and Master C. Dickens junr, Mr Morgan
(who suddenly appeared on Christmas
Day, having just returned from America)
Mr M. Stone, Mr Chorley and
Mr Dickenson.<br />

&nbsp;The latter gentleman has not yet entirely
recovered from the effects of a
most disastrous railway accident in
which he was a sufferer, and had it not
been for the courage and intrepidity
of Mr Dickens, he would not now be
spending his Christmas at Gad's Hill.
A short time before the accident occurred,
Mr Dickenson had a dispute with a French
gentleman about the opening of the window
when the former offered to change places, if
the open window was disagreeable to his fellow
traveller&mdash;this they did.&mdash;<br />

&nbsp;Then came the accident, accompanied by all
its frightful incidents. The French gentleman
was killed, Mr Dickenson was stunned and
hurled with great violence under the debris
of a carriage.</div>
<div class='center'>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[<a href="images/i_p_201.png">201</a>]</span></p>

<div class='bigger'>&nbsp;Mr Dickens, who was in another compartment,
managed to crawl out of the window
and then, caring little for his own safety, busied
himself in helping the wounded. Whilst
engaged in doing this, he passed by a carriage,
underneath which he saw a gentleman
(Mr Dickenson) lying perfectly still, and bleeding
from the eyes, ears, nose and mouth.<br />

&nbsp;He was immediately taken to the town
of Staplehurst where he so far recovered as to
be able to return to London, that evening.<br />

&nbsp;Next morning he was suffering from a very
severe concussion of the brain and was ill for
many weeks&mdash;But to our subject.<br />

&nbsp;On Christmas Day, Mr, Mrs &amp; Miss Malleson
came to dinner. At about 9, an
ex tempore dance began and was kept
up till about 2 o'clock Tuesday morning.
During the week, billiards has
been much resorted to. (See next page)<br />

&nbsp;All the visitors are still here, except
Mr Fechter and family who left on December
26th, and Mr Morgan (who
is to return on 31st. Talking of Mr Fechter,
our readers will be glad to hear
that he has made a most decided success
in his new piece entitled&mdash;The
Master of Ravenswood&mdash;</div>

<div class='center'>Sporting Intelligence.<br />
Billiards</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the matches that have been
played during the past week the most
important was a Great Handicap on
Christmas Day, the prize being a pewter.
Annexed is an account of it.<br />

<p>Our space will not allow us to enter
into the minute details of this match
suffice it to say that Mr Dickenson won
but that as regards good play, he was
excelled by Mr Stone (who, however,
was so heavily weighted that he could
not win. Great credit is due to Mr Ch
Dickens junr for the way in which he
handicapped the men.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday 30th a match is to be played
between The Earl of Darnley and Mr
M Stone.

</div>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a circular issued last August, we announced
that a final number of the Gad's Hill Gazette was to be published
this Xmas. We are grieved however to state, that the
shortening of the Wimbledon School holidays (in which establishment
the Editor is a pupil) has rendered this impossible.</p>

<p>It is with feelings of the deepest regret that we find ourselves
obliged to conclude the publication of our Journal in
this sudden and unexpected manner, but we feel sure that
the great indulgence of the Public will overlook this, as it
has done many other great errors in the Gad's Hill Gazette.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we beg to take leave of our Subscribers in
our public capacity of Editor, thanking them for their kindness
in supporting our Journal, and wishing them all</p>

<p>Mrs. Hulkes had a number of pleasant recollections of
Gad's Hill Place, and of Charles Dickens and his family.
"As a girl," said this lady, "I was an admiring reader of his
works, and I longed to see and know the author; but little
did I think that my high ambition would ever be gratified."
That a warm friendship existed between his admirer and
Charles Dickens, who subsequently became her near neighbour,
is evidenced by the fact that, in reply to her request, he
allowed this lady the great privilege of reading the catastrophe
of that exquisitely-pathetic and nobly-altruistic story of <i>A
Tale of Two Cities</i>, some weeks before its publication, as
appears from the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">"<span class="smcap">Gad's Hill Place</span>,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Higham by Rochester, Kent</span>.<br />
"<i>Sunday evening, Sixteenth Oct., 1857.</i><br />
</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Hulkes</span>,</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My daughter has shown me your note, and it has
impressed me with the horrible determination to become
a new kind of Bluebeard, and lay an awful injunction of
secrecy on you for five mortal weeks.</p>

<p>"Here is the remainder of the <i>Tale of Two Cities</i>. Not
half-a-dozen of my oldest and most trusty literary friends
have seen it. It is a real pleasure to me to entrust you with
the catastrophe, and to ask you to keep a grim and inflexible
silence on the subject until it is published. When you have
read the proofs, will you kindly return them to me?</p>

<p>"With my regard to Mr. Hulkes,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">"Believe me always,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"Faithfully yours,</span><br />

<div class='secsig'>"<span class="smcap">Mrs. Hulkes.</span>"</div></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Hulkes said that when Dickens went to Paris in
1863, he jokingly said to her, "I am going to Paris; what
shall I bring you?" She replied, "A good photograph of
yourself, as I do not like the one you gave me; and I hear
the French people are more successful than the English, or
their climate may help them." And he brought a photograph
of himself, of which there were only four printed.
It now graces Mrs. Hulkes' drawing-room, and represents
the novelist very life-like in full face, head and bust. The
photograph was taken by Alphonse Maze, and has been
exquisitely engraved in Mr. Kitton's <i>Charles Dickens by Pen
and Pencil</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hulkes mentioned a curious and interesting circumstance.
On the night before the funeral of her friend, Miss
Dickens sent down to the Little Hermitage to ask if she
could kindly give her some roses. Mrs. Hulkes cut a
quantity from one of the trees in the garden (Lamarque,
she believes), and the tree never bloomed again, and soon
after died. No doubt, as she observed, it bled to death from
the excessive cutting. It was the second case only of the
kind in her experience as a rose-grower during very many
years.</p>

<p>Charles Dickens also took interest in his friend's son (their
only child, who has since finished his University career),
and this gentleman prizes as a relic a copy of <i>A Child's
History of England</i>, which was presented to him, with the
following inscription written in the characteristic blue ink&mdash;"Charles
Dickens. To his little friend, Cecil James
Hulkes. Christmas Eve, 1864." In a letter to Miss Hogarth,
written from New York, on Friday, 3rd January, 1868, he
says:&mdash;"I have a letter from Mrs. Hulkes by this post,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
wherein the boy encloses a violet, now lying on the table
before me. Let her know that it arrived safely and retaining
its colour."</p>

<p>There are many interesting relics of Gad's Hill Place now
in the possession of the family at the Little Hermitage,
notably Charles Dickens's seal with his crest, and the initials
C. D., his pen-tray, his desk, a photograph of the study on
8th June, 1870 (a present from Miss Hogarth), the portrait
above referred to, an arm-chair, a drawing-room settee, a
dressing-table, and a library writing-table.</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>On another occasion we were favoured with an interview
by Mr. J. N. Malleson, of Brighton, who formerly resided at
the Great Hermitage, Higham, and who was a neighbour of
Charles Dickens for many years. Mr. Malleson came to the
Great Hermitage in 1859, and a day or two after Christmas
Day in that year&mdash;having previously been a guest at the
wedding of Dickens's second daughter Kate, with Mr. Charles
Alston Collins&mdash;he met the novelist, who, stopping to chat
pleasantly, asked his neighbours where they dined at Christmas?
"Oh, Darby and Joan," said our informant. Dickens
laughingly replied:&mdash;"That shall never happen again"; and
the following year, and every year afterwards, except when
their friend was in America, Mr. and Mrs. Malleson received
and accepted invitations to dine at Gad's Hill Place. On
the exception in question, the family of Dickens dined at
the Great Hermitage.</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>In the autumn of the year 1889 we had a most interesting
chat with Mr. William Stocker Trood, at his residence,
Spearcehay Farm, Pitminster, pleasantly situated in the vale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of Taunton, for many years landlord of the Sir John Falstaff
at Gad's Hill. The first noteworthy circumstance to record
is that his name is not <i>Edwin</i> Trood, as commonly supposed,
but William Stocker, as above stated, Stocker being an old
family name. This fact disposes of the supposition that the
former two names, with the alteration of a single letter, gave
rise in Dickens's mind to the designation of the principal
character in <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>. The name of
"Trood" is by the substitution of one letter easily converted
into Drood, and that word is perhaps more euphonious with
"Edwin" as prefixed to it; but "William Stocker" is not
by any means easily converted into "Edwin." The idea that
"Edwin Drood" is derived from "William Stocker Trood"
may therefore be dismissed as a popular fallacy. It may be
mentioned, however, <i>en passant</i>, that Mr. Trood had a brother
named Edward, who sometimes visited him at the Falstaff,
and also a son who bore the name of his uncle.</p>

<p>We found our informant to be wonderfully genial, hale and
hearty, although in his eighty-fifth year. He had a perfect
recollection of Charles Dickens, and remembered his first
coming to Gad's Hill Place. Before the house was properly
furnished and put in order, both Mr. and Mrs. Dickens sometimes
slept at the Falstaff; and afterwards, when visitors
were staying at Gad's Hill Place, and the bedrooms there
were full, some of them slept at the Inn; in particular, John
Forster, Wilkie Collins, and Marcus Stone. He said Mr.
Dickens was a very nice man to speak to, and Mrs. Dickens
was a very nice lady. They were always kind and pleasant
as neighbours, but Mr. Dickens did not talk much. Said
Mr. Trood:&mdash;"When I was at Higham, Mr. Dickens used to
say no one could put in a word; I had all the talk to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
myself." The sons were all very pleasant; in fact, he
liked the family very much indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. Trood sometimes acted as local banker to Charles
Dickens, and used to cash his cheques for him. Only the
day before his death, he cashed a cheque for &pound;22, and was
subsequently offered &pound;24 for it by an admirer of Dickens
who desired the autograph; but to his credit it should be
mentioned that he did not accept the offer.</p>

<p>Our informant next spoke of the wonderful partiality
of Dickens to cricket; he would stand out all night if he
could watch a cricket match. The matches were always
played in Mr. Dickens's field, and the business meetings
of the club were held monthly at the Falstaff. Mr. Trood
was Treasurer of the club. Occasionally there was a
dinner.</p>

<p>A circumstance was related which made a profound impression
on our friend. The family at Gad's Hill Place were
very fond of music, and on one occasion there were present
as visitors two great violinists, one a German and the other an
Italian, and it was a debated question among the listeners
outside the gates, where the music could be distinctly heard,
which played the better. Mr. Trood had just returned from
Gravesend in the cool of the summer evening, about ten
o'clock, and stood in the road opposite listening, "spellbound,"
to the delightful music. Miss Dickens played the
accompaniments.</p>

<p>Mr. Trood spoke with a lively and appreciative recollection
of the Christmas sports that were held in a field at the back
of Gad's Hill Place, and of the good order and nice feeling
that prevailed at those gatherings, although several thousand
people were present. Among the games that were played,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the wheeling of barrows by blind-folded men seemed to
tickle him most.</p>

<p>Our octogenarian friend also spoke of the great love of
Dickens for scarlet geraniums. Hundreds of the "Tom
Thumb" variety were planted in the beds on the front lawn
and in the back garden at Gad's Hill Place.</p>

<p>Soon after the terrible railway accident at Staplehurst,
Dickens came over to the Falstaff and spoke to Mr. Trood,
who congratulated him. Said Dickens, "I never thought I
should be here again." It is a wonderful coincidence to
record, that a young gentleman named Dickenson, who
subsequently became intimate with the novelist, changed
places (so as to get the benefit of meeting the fresh air) with
a French gentleman in the same carriage who was killed, and
Mr. Dickenson escaped! The accident happened on the 9th
June, 1865, and Dickens died on the "fatal anniversary," 9th
June, 1870.</p>

<p>Mr. Trood confirmed his daughter's (Mrs. Latter's) account
of the <i>fra&ccedil;as</i> with the men and performing bears, given in
another chapter, adding, "That <i>was</i> a concern."</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>The beautiful city of Exeter is not far from Taunton, and
we naturally avail ourselves of the opportunity of stopping
there for a few hours, and stroll over to see the village of
Alphington. It was here, in the year 1839, that Charles
Dickens took and furnished Mile End Cottage for his father
and mother and their youngest son. He thus describes the
event in a letter to Forster:&mdash;"I took a little house for them
this morning (5th March, 1839), and if they are not pleased
with it I shall be grievously disappointed. Exactly a mile
beyond the city on the Plymouth road there are two white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
cottages: one is theirs, and the other belongs to their landlady.
I almost forget the number of rooms, but there is
an excellent parlour with two other rooms on the ground
floor, there is really a beautiful little room over the parlour
which I am furnishing as a drawing-room, and there is a
splendid garden. The paint and paper throughout is new
and fresh and cheerful-looking, the place is clean beyond all
description, and the neighbourhood I suppose the most
beautiful in this most beautiful of English counties." The
negotiations with the landlady and the operation of furnishing
the house are most humorously pourtrayed in the same
letter.</p>

<p>The cottage is also described in <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, which
he was writing at the time. Mrs. Nickleby, in allusion to her
old home, calls it "the beautiful little thatched white house
one storey high, covered all over with ivy and creeping
plants, with an exquisite little porch with twining honeysuckles
and all sorts of things."</p>

<p>Fifty years have passed since the parents of the novelist
went to live at Alphington, which, notwithstanding the subsequent
growth of the city, still continues to be a pretty suburb
with fine views of the Ide Hills to the westward, and Heavitree
to the eastward. Our efforts to obtain any reminiscences
of the Dickens family in the village were quite unsuccessful&mdash;so
long a time had elapsed since their departure&mdash;although,
to oblige us, the vicar of the place kindly made enquiries,
and took some interest in the matter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>CHARLES DICKENS AND STROOD.</h3>

<div class="hang2">"So altered was the battle-ground, where thousands upon thousands had
been killed in the great fight."&mdash;<i>The Battle of Life.</i></div>

<div class="hang2">"Keep me always at it, I'll keep you always at it, you keep somebody
else always at it. There you are, with the Whole Duty of Man in a
commercial country."&mdash;<i>Little Dorrit.</i></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> town of Strood,&mdash;the Roman <i>Strata</i>,&mdash;which stands on
the left bank of the river Medway, has, like the city of
Rochester, its interesting historical associations. Its Church,
dedicated to St. Nicholas, stands high on the north side of
the London road leading to Gad's Hill, and has a brass of
T. Glover and his three wives. At one time there was a
hospital for travellers, founded by Bishop Glanville (<i>temp.</i>
Richard I.), near the Church. The most interesting remains
are, however, those of the Temple Farm, distant about half
a mile south, formerly (<i>temp.</i> Henry II.) the mansion of the
Knights Templars of the Teutonic order, to whom it, together
with the lands thereto belonging, was given by that monarch.
The gift was confirmed by King John and by Henry III.
(1227); but the unfortunate brethren of the order did not
retain possession more than a century, for in the reign of
Edward II. they were dispossessed of their lands and goods,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
under pretence of their leading a vicious course of life, but in
reality to satisfy the avarice of their dispossessors. The
present building dates from about James I., has one fine room
overlooking the river, and underneath is a spacious vault
called by Grose the "Preceptory," excavated out of the chalk,
and having fine groined stone arches and aisles&mdash;the walls are
of very great thickness. Near Frindsbury Church&mdash;in which
are three most interesting wall-paintings of St. William the
Baker of Perth, St. Lawrence, and another figure, all three
discovered on the jambs of the Norman windows only a
few years ago&mdash;stands the Quarry House, a handsome old
red-brick mansion, "described as more Jacobean than
Elizabethan," built in the form of a capital E, each storey
slightly receding behind the front level of that beneath it,
the top tapering into pretty gables, the effect being enhanced
by heavy buttresses.</div>

<p>There is a dreadful legend of the ancient people of Strood
common to several other parts of the kingdom, <i>e.g.</i> Auster
in Dorsetshire, which the quaint and diligent Lambarde,
quoting from Polydore Virgil, evidently regarded as serious,
and takes immense pains to confute! It relates to St.
Thomas &agrave; Becket and his contention with King Henry II.,
whereby he began to be looked upon as the King's enemy,
and as such began to be "so commonly neglected, contemned,
and hated:&mdash;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>
<img src="images/i_236.png" width="600" height="354" alt="Temple Farm Strood" title="" />
</div>

<p>"That when as it happened him upon a time to come to
<i>Stroude</i>, the Inhabitants thereabouts (being desirous to dispite
that good Father) sticked not to cut the tail from the

<p>In a lecture delivered here some years ago, the Rev. Canon
Scott Robertson, Editor of <i>Arch&aelig;ologia Cantiana</i>, gave a
graphic picture of "Strood in the Olden Times." To this
we are much indebted for the opportunity of giving an
abstract of several of the most interesting details.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century Strood and Rochester were the
scene of a severe struggle between Simon de Montfort, Earl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
of Leicester, the leader of the Barons in their war against
Henry III. to resist the aggressive encroachments of the King
on the liberties of the subject, and the supporters of that
monarch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_238.png" width="400" height="331" alt="Crypt Temple Farm" title="" />
</div>

<p>Simon de Montfort, who was a Strood landowner, and
possessed of other large properties in Kent, took the lead,
followed by several other nobles, in the siege of Rochester.
Their first obstacle was the fortified gate-house at the Strood
end of Rochester Bridge, and for some time their efforts were
in vain, till at length, by means of small ships filled with
inflammable matter, set on fire and driven towards the centre
of the wooden bridge, causing "actual or expected ignition of
the timbers," the King's soldiers were dismayed and retreated.
The Earl of Gloucester simultaneously reached the south end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of the city, and the Barons took possession thereof, sacking
the town, monastery, and Cathedral Church. The garrison
of the Castle shut themselves up in the strong Norman
Keep, and held it till relieved by Prince Edward, the King's
son.</p>

<p>The Castle was subsequently taken by Simon de Montfort
after the Battle of Lewes (1264), where Henry III. was taken
prisoner and brought to Rochester, and a Proclamation was
issued transferring the custody of the Royal Castle to the
Barons.</p>

<p>At the Battle of Evesham (1265) Simon de Montfort was
slain; and the King, on becoming master of the situation,
imposed a fine, equivalent to about &pound;1,500 of our money, on
Strood, because it was the headquarters of Simon during his
assault on Rochester. The fine caused much ill-feeling
between the two towns, which lasted until the reign of
Edward I. Such was Strood in the olden times.</p>

<p>Long years have since passed, and the amenities of
an industrial age have succeeded to these turmoils. The
town of Strood appears to be flourishing, and now possesses
large engineering works, cement manufactories, flour mills,
and other extensive industries.</p>

<p>Allusion has been previously made to a very entertaining
<i>brochure</i>, entitled <i>Charles Dickens and Rochester</i>, by Mr.
Robert Langton, F. R. Hist. Soc. of Manchester (himself, we
believe, a Rochester man). In it there is scarcely any
reference to Strood, although the sister-town, Chatham, is
freely mentioned. Our enquiries at Strood, on the Tuesday
and subsequently, resulted in the discovery of many most
interesting memorials of Charles Dickens in connection with
that town, enough almost to fill a small volume. There was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
a general impression that Dickens had no great liking for
Strood, and yet it was a doctor from that town who was one
of his most intimate friends, and who attended him in his last
illness; it was a builder in Strood who executed most of the
alterations and repairs at Gad's Hill Place; it was a Strood
contractor who gave him the souvenir of old Rochester
Bridge; it was at Strood that an eminent local scientist lived,
who was incidentally, but very importantly, associated with
him in the movement connected with the Guild of Literature
and Art; and it was at a quiet roadside inn at Strood that
he sometimes called to refresh himself after one of those
long walks, alone or with friends, for which he was famous.</p>

<p>Let us reverse the order of the above, and give a recollection
from the last-mentioned. The "Crispin and Crispianus"
is a very old-fashioned inn, which stands on the north side
of the London road just out of Strood, and was, as we were
informed, erected some centuries ago. It is a long building,
of brick below, with an overhanging upper floor and weather-boarded
front, surmounted by a single dormer window.
The sanded floor of the common parlour is, as the saying
goes, "as clean as a new pin." Round the room is a settle
terminating with arms at each side of the door, which is
opposite the fireplace. Mrs. Masters, the cheerful and
obliging landlady, who has lived here thirty years, describes
Dickens to us (as we sit in the seat he used now and then
to occupy), when on one of his walks, as habited in low shoes
not over-well mended, loose large check-patterned trousers
that sometimes got entangled in the shoes when walking, a
brown coat thrown open, sometimes without waistcoat, a belt
instead of braces, a necktie which now and then got round
towards his ear, and a large-brimmed felt hat, similar to an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
American's, set well at the back of his head. In his hand he
carried by the middle an umbrella, which he was in the habit
of constantly swinging, and if he had dogs (a not unfrequent
occurrence), he had a small
whip as well. He walked in
the middle of the road at a
rapid pace, upright, but with
his eyes cast down as if
in deep thought. When he
called at the Crispin for refreshment, usually a glass of ale
(mild sixpenny&mdash;bitter ale was not drawn in those days), or
a little cold brandy and water, he walked straight in, and sat
down at the corner of the settle on the right-hand side where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the arm is, opposite the fire-place; he rarely spoke to any one,
but looked round as though taking in everything at a glance.
(In <i>David Copperfield</i> he says, "I looked at nothing, that I
know of, but I saw everything.") Once he and a friend were
sheltering there during a thunderstorm (by a coincidence, a
storm occurs at the time we are here), and while Dickens
stood looking out of the window he saw opposite a poor
woman with a baby, who appeared very worn, wet, and
travel-stained. She too was sheltering from the rain.</p>
<div class='center'> <a name="crispin" id="crispin"></a><table class="crispin" summary="crispin">

<div class='blockquot2'>
<p>"Call her in here," said Dickens. Mrs. Masters obeyed.</p>


<p>"Now," said he, "draw her some brandy."</p>

<p>"How much?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Never mind," he answered, "draw her some."</p>

<p>The landlady drew her four-pennyworth, the quantity
generally served.</p></div>
</td>
</tr></table></div>

<p>"Now," said Dickens to the woman, "drink that up," which
she did, and soon seemed refreshed. Dickens gave her a
shilling, and remarked to Mrs. Masters that "now she will go
on her way rejoicing." The story is a trivial one, but the
units make the aggregate, and it sufficiently indicates his
kindness of heart and thoughtfulness for others.</p>

<p>In some of his walks Dickens was accompanied either by
his sister-in-law, Miss Hogarth, or by friends who were staying
at "Gad's" (or the "Place," as it was sometimes called).
Mrs. Masters, whose recollections of Dickens are very vivid,
said&mdash;"Lor! we never thought much about him when he
was alive; it was only when his death took place that we
understood what a great man he was." Alas! it is not the
first instance that "a prophet is not without honour, save in his
own country, and in his own house." The news of his death
was a great shock to Mrs. Masters, who heard of it from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Edward, son of Mr. W. S. Trood, the landlord of the Sir
John Falstaff, as he was bearing the intelligence to Rochester
within half-an-hour after the event.</p>

<p>In passing we should mention, that the Crispin and Crispianus
has been immortalized in the chapter on "Tramps,"
in <i>The Uncommercial Traveller</i>, where, in reference to the
handicrafts of certain tramps, Dickens imagines himself to be
a travelling clockmaker, and after adjusting "t'ould clock" in
the keeper's kitchen, "he sees to something wrong with the
bell of the turret stable clock up at the Hall [Cobham Hall].&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Our task at length accomplished, we should be taken
into an enormous servants'-hall, and there regaled with beef
and bread, and powerful ale. Then, paid freely, we should be
at liberty to go, and should be told by a pointing helper to
keep round over yinder by the blasted ash, and so straight
through the woods till we should see the town-lights right
afore us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So should we lie that night at the ancient sign
of the Crispin and Crispianus [at Strood], and rise early next
morning to be betimes on tramp again."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>
<p>We are also indebted to Mrs. Masters for an introduction
to our next informant, Mr. J. Couchman, master-builder
and undertaker of Strood, who, though advanced in years
and tried by illness, is very free and chatty; and from him
and his son we obtained some interesting facts. He had
worked for Charles Dickens at Gad's Hill Place, from the
date of his going there ("which," says Mr. Couchman, "was on
Whitsun Monday, 1856,") until the 11th June, 1870, two days
after the sad occurrence "which eclipsed the gaiety of nations."</p>

<p>From Mr. Couchman's standpoint as a tradesman, it is
interesting to record his experience of Dickens in his own
words. "Mr. Dickens," he says, "was always very straightforward,
honourable, and kind, and paid his bills most regularly.
The first work I did for him was to make a dog-kennel;
I also put up the ch&acirc;let at Gad's Hill. When it was
forwarded from London, which was by water, Mr. Fechter
[whose name he did not at first remember] sent a Frenchman
to assist in the erection. The ch&acirc;let consisted of ninety-four
pieces, all fitting accurately together like a puzzle. The
Frenchman did not understand it, and could not make out
the fitting of the pieces. So I asked Mr. Henry [Mr. Henry
Fielding Dickens, the novelist's sixth son, the present Recorder
of Deal] if he understood French. He said 'Yes,' and
told me the names of the different pieces, and I managed it
without the Frenchman, who stayed the night, and went away
next day." In conversation, we suggest that the circumstance
of the ch&acirc;let having been made in Switzerland may
have embarrassed the Frenchman, he not having been accustomed
to that kind of work. In his letter to Forster of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
7th June, 1865, Dickens says:&mdash;"The ch&acirc;let is going on
excellently, though the ornamental part is more slowly put
together than the substantial. It will really be a very pretty
thing; and in the summer (supposing it not to be blown
away in the spring), the upper room will make a charming
study. It is much higher than we supposed."</p>

<p>Mr. Couchman also took down the ch&acirc;let after Charles
Dickens's death, and erected it at the Crystal Palace at
Sydenham, where it remained for a short time, and was
subsequently presented to the Earl of Darnley by several
members of the Dickens family. His lordship afterwards
ordered him to fit it up at Cobham Hall, where, as previously
stated, it now stands. The woods of which it is constructed
he believed to be Baltic oak and a kind of pine, the lighter
parts being of maple or sycamore. We saw it subsequently.</p>

<p>Several contracts were entered into by Mr. Couchman with
Charles Dickens for the extension and modification of Gad's
Hill Place, notably during the year 1861. We are favoured
with a sight of an original specification signed by both parties,
which is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='center'>"Specification of works proposed to be done at Gad's Hill House,

<p>What is most interesting to notice in the above specification,
is the careful way in which Dickens appears to have
mastered all the details, and the very sensible interlineations
given in italics which he made, (1) as to the sashes and
weights, (2) as to the two cisterns, and especially (3) in the
final memorandum as to <i>time</i>.</p>

<p>It is also worthy of remark, that the work <i>was</i> completed in
the specified time, the bill duly sent in, and the next day
Dickens sent a cheque for the amount.</p>

<p>Another contract, amounting to &pound;393, was executed by Mr.
Couchman, for extensions at Gad's Hill. On its completion,
Mr. Dickens paid him by two cheques. He went up to
London to the Bank (Coutts's in the Strand) to cash them.
The clerk just looked at the cheques, the signature apparently
being very familiar to him, and then put the usual question&mdash;"How
will you have it?" to which he replied, "Notes,
please."</p>

<p>It appears that, as is frequently the case in large establishments,
orders were sometimes given by the servants for work
which the master knew nothing about until the bill was
presented; and to prevent this, Dickens issued instructions
to the tradesmen that they were not to execute any work
for him without his written authority. The following is an
illustration of this new arrangement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"<span class="smcap">Gad's Hill Place</span>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">Higham by Rochester, Kent</span>.</span><br />
"<i>Thursday, 5th Nov., 1858.</i><br />
</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Couchman</span>,</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Please to ease the coach-house doors, and to put up
some pegs, agreeably to George Belcher's directions.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Charles Dickens</span>."<br />
</div></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>It should be mentioned that George Belcher was the coachman
at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. Couchman recalls an interesting custom that was
maintained at Gad's Hill. There were a number of tin check
plates, marked respectively 3<i>d.</i> and 6<i>d.</i> each, which enabled the
person to whom they were given to obtain an equivalent in
refreshment of any kind at the Sir John Falstaff. The
threepenny checks were for the workmen, and the sixpenny
ones for the tradesmen. The chief housemaid had the distribution
of these checks to persons employed in the house,
the head-gardener to those engaged in the gardens, and the
coachman to those in the stables. On one occasion, our
informant remembers when his men were engaged upon some
work at Gad's Hill, such checks were given out to them, and
that he also had one offered to him; but, recollecting that
his position as a master scarcely entitled him to the privilege,
he stated his objections to the housemaid, who said in reply
that it was a pity to break an old custom, he had better have
one. "So," says our informant, "I had a sixpenny ticket with
the others, and obtained my refreshment."</p>

<p>He has in his photographic album a carte-de-visite of
Charles Dickens, by Watkins. It is the well-known one in
which the novelist is represented in a sitting position, dressed
in a grey suit; and the owner considered it a very good
likeness. He also showed us a funeral card which he thought
had been sent to him by the family of Dickens at the time of
his death, but judging by its contents, this seems impossible.
It is, however, well worth transcribing:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>&mdash;</p>
<div class='bbox'>

</div>
<p>Mr. Couchman confirms the verbal sketch of Dickens
as drawn by his neighbour, Mrs. Masters, and states that
Dickens used to put up his dogs ("Linda" and "Turk"),
"boisterous companions as they always were," in the stables
whenever he came to see him on business.</p>

<p>Mr. William Ball, J.P., of Hillside, Strood, kindly favoured
us with many interviews, and generally took great interest
in the subject of our visit to "Dickens-Land," rendering
invaluable assistance in our enquiries. This gentleman is the
son of Mr. John H. Ball, the well-known contractor, who
removed old Rochester Bridge; he is also a brother-in-law of
the late gifted tenor, Mr. Joseph Maas, to whom a handsome
memorial tablet, consisting of a marble medallion of the
deceased, over which is a lyre with one of the strings
broken, has since been erected on the east wall of the south
transept of Rochester Cathedral. By Mr. Ball's considerate
courtesy and that of his daughters, we are allowed to
see many interesting relics of Charles Dickens and Gad's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Hill.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> When Mr. Ball's father removed the old bridge in
1859, it will be remembered that he offered to present the
novelist with one of the balustrades as a souvenir, the offer
being gracefully and promptly accepted, as the following
letter testifies:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>
<p>The present Mr. William Ball, then a young lad, was the
bearer of the gift, and on being asked by us why he didn't ask
to see the great novelist, replies, "Yes, I ought to have done
so, but I was afraid of the dogs!"</p>

<p>The balustrade, which was placed on the back lawn at Gad's
Hill, was mounted on a square pedestal, on the sides of which
were representations of the four seasons, and a sun-dial
crowned the capital. Something like it, but a little modified,
appears in one of Mr. Luke Fildes's beautiful illustrations
to the original edition of <i>Edwin Drood</i>, entitled "Jasper's
Sacrifices." Three more of the balustrades now ornament
Mr. Ball's garden at Hillside.</p>

<p>Mr. Ball the elder was invited to send in a tender for the
construction of the tunnel at Gad's Hill previously mentioned,
but it was not accepted, as appears from a letter addressed to
him by Mr. Alfred L. Dickens (Charles Dickens's brother), of
which we are allowed to take a copy:&mdash;</p>

<p>Among the Dickens relics at Hillside, we are shown by
Mr. Ball the pretty set of five silver bells presented by his
friend Mr. F. Lehmann, to the novelist, who always used
them when driving out in his basket pony-phaeton. They
are fastened on to a leather pad, and make a pleasant musical
sound when shaken. They are of graduated sizes, the largest
being somewhat smaller than a tennis-ball, and appear to be
in the key of C: comprising the Tonic, Third, Fifth, Octave,
and Octave of the Third.</p>

<p>There is also a hall clock with maker's name&mdash;"Bennett,
Cheapside, London." This was the "werry identical" clock
respecting which Dickens wrote the following characteristically
humorous letter to Sir John Bennett:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"Since my hall clock was sent to your establishment
to be cleaned it has gone (as indeed it always had)
perfectly well, but has struck the hours with great reluctance,
and after enduring internal agonies of a most
distressing nature, it has now ceased striking altogether.
Though a happy release for the clock, this is not convenient
to the household. If you can send down any confidential
person with whom the clock can confer, I think it may have
something on its works that it would be glad to make a clean
breast of.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"Faithfully yours,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Charles Dickens</span>."<br />
</div></div>

<p>Included among the relics are a very handsome mahogany
fire-screen in three folds, of red morocco, with Grecian key-border,
a musical Canterbury, and a bookcase. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
most interesting object from an art point of view is an
India proof copy, "before letters," of Sir Edwin Landseer's
beautiful picture of "King Charles's Spaniels," the original of
which is said to have been painted for the late Mr. Vernon in
two days, and is now in the National Gallery. The engraving
of the picture is by Outram. It has the initials in pencil
"E. L.," and a little ticket on the frame&mdash;"Lot 445," that being
the number in the auctioneer's catalogue.</p>

<p>The following is the story as recently told by Mr. W. P.
Frith, R.A., in his most interesting and readable <i>Autobiography
and Reminiscences</i>, 1887:&mdash;</p>

<p>"His" [Sir Edwin's] "rapidity of execution was extraordinary.
In the National Gallery there is a picture of Two
Spaniels, of what is erroneously called the Charles II. breed
(the real dog of that time is of a different form and breed
altogether, as may be seen in pictures of the period), the size
of life, with appropriate accompaniments, painted by him in
two days. An empty frame had been sent to the British
Institution, where it was hung on the wall, waiting for its
tenant&mdash;a picture of a lady with dogs&mdash;till Landseer felt the
impossibility of finishing the picture satisfactorily. Time had
passed, till two days only remained before the opening of the
Exhibition. Something must be done; and in the time
named those wonderfully life-like little dogs were produced."</p>

<p>Mr. Ball has also an interesting photograph of the "Last
Lot," some bottles of wine, evidently taken on the occasion of
the sale at Gad's Hill Place after Dickens's death, the auctioneer
being represented with his hammer raised ready to fall,
and a smile upon his face. Among the crowd, consisting
principally of London and local dealers, may be seen two
local policemen with peaked caps, and auctioneer's porters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
in shirt-sleeves and aprons. The sale took place in a large
tent at the back of the house and close to the well, which can
be readily seen through an opening in the tent.</p>

<p>The next person whom we meet at Strood is Mr. Charles
Roach Smith, F.S.A., the eminent arch&aelig;ologist, who has
achieved a European reputation, and from whom we get
many interesting particulars relating to Dickens. We heard
some idle gossip at Rochester to the effect that Mr. Roach
Smith always felt a little "touchy" about the satire on
arch&aelig;ology in <i>Pickwick</i>, <i>in re</i> "Bill Stumps, his mark."
That, however, we took <i>cum grano salis</i>, because this gentleman,
from his delightful conversation and frank manner, is
evidently above any such littleness. He is, however, free
to confess, that Dickens had not much love for Strood, but
infinitely preferred Chatham.</p>

<p>There had been but little personal intercourse between
Dickens and Mr. Roach Smith, though each respected the
other. Our informant says that, soon after the novelist came
to Gad's Hill Place, Mrs. Dickens called and left her husband's
card, which he, whether rightly or not, took as an intimation
that the acquaintance was not to be extended. He spoke
with all the enthusiasm of a man of science, and rather
bitterly too, of a certain reading given by Dickens at Chatham
to an overflowing house, whereas on the same evening a
distinguished Professor of Agriculture (a Mr. Roberts or
Robinson, we believe), who came to instruct the people at
Ashford (one of the neighbouring towns) by means of a
lecture, failed to secure an audience, and only got a few
pence for admissions. The learned Professor subsequently
poured forth his troubles to Mr. Roach Smith, from whom he
obtained sympathy and hospitality. We venture to remind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
our good friend that the public in general much prefer
amusement to instruction, at which he laughs, and says that
in this matter he perfectly agrees with us. He expresses his
strong opinion as to Dickens's reading of the "Murder of
Nancy" (<i>Oliver Twist</i>), which he characterizes as "repulsive
and indecent."</p>

<p>The most important communication made to us by Mr.
Roach Smith is that contained in volume ii. of his recently
published <i>Reminiscences and Retrospections, Social and Arch&aelig;ological</i>,
1886. As this interesting work may not be generally
accessible, it is as well to quote the passage intact. It has
reference to the Guild of Literature and Art, for the promotion
of which Dickens, Lord Lytton, John Forster, Mark Lemon,
John Leech, and others, gave so much valuable time and
energy, in addition to liberal pecuniary support. The following
is the extract:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of Mr. Dodd I knew much. He was one of my earliest
friends when I lived in Liverpool Street&mdash;I may say, one of
my earliest patrons; and the intimacy continued up to his
death, a few years since. The story of his connection with
the movement for a dramatic college, and of his rapid
separation from it, a deposition by order of the projectors
and directors, forms a curious episode in the history of our
friendship; and especially so, as I had an important, though
unseen, part to sustain.</p>

<p>"In the summer of 1858 I was summoned to Mr. Dodd's
residence at the City Wharf, New North Road, Hoxton, to
give consent to be a trustee, with Messrs. Cobden and Bright,
for five acres of land, which Mr. Dodd was about to give for
the building of a dramatic college, which had been resolved
on at a public meeting, held on the 21st of July in this year,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
in the Princess's Theatre, Mr. Charles Kean acting as chairman.
'I give this most freely,' said Mr. Dodd to me, 'for it is to
the stage I am indebted for my education; to it I owe whatsoever
may be good in me.' That there was much good in
him, thousands can testify; and thousands yet to come will be
evidence to his benevolence. Of course, I felt pleased in being
selected to act as a trustee for this gift. I conceived, and I
suppose I was correct, that Mr. Dodd intended that his gift
was strictly for a dramatic college, and for no other purpose,
then or thereafter. Having expressed my willingness and
resolution to be faithful to the trust, I said, 'I presume, Mr.
Dodd, you stipulate for a presentation?' He looked rather
surprised; and asked his solicitor, who sat by him, how they
came to overlook this? Both of them directly agreed that this
simple return should be required.</p>

<p>"I must leave such of my readers as feel inclined, to search
in the public journals for the correspondence between the
directors and Mr. Dodd up to the 13th of January, 1859, when,
at a meeting held in the Adelphi Theatre, Lord Tenterden in
the chair, it was stated that Mr. Dodd evinced, through his
solicitor, a disposition to fence round his gift with legal
restrictions and stipulations, which apprised the committee of
coming difficulty; and the meeting unanimously agreed to
decline Mr. Dodd's offer of land. Previously and subsequently
to this, Mr. Dodd was most discourteously commented on
and attacked in the newspapers, the editors of which, however,
sided with him. I was told that the stipulation for a
presentation was the great offence; but I should think that
the provision made against the improper use of the land must
have been the real grievance. In the very last letter I
received from Mr. Dodd, not very long anterior to his death,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
he says that Mark Lemon told him that Charles Dickens
had said he had never occasion to repent but of two things,
one being his conduct to Mr. Dodd. That Dickens,
Thackeray, and others sincerely believed they were taking
the best steps for accomplishing their benevolent object, there
can be no doubt; their judgment, not their heart, was wrong.
The scheme was based upon a wrong principle, as was shown
by its collapse in less than twenty years, after the expenditure
of very large subscriptions, and the patronage of the Queen.
Articles in <i>The Era</i> of the 22nd July, 1877, leave no doubt,
while they clearly reveal the causes of failure."</p>

<p>It may be mentioned that the Mr. Henry Dodd above
referred to, appears to have been a large city contractor, or
something of that kind. According to Mr. Roach Smith,
what with him led on to fortune was a long and heavy fall of
snow, which had filled the streets of the city of London, and
rendered traffic impossible. The city was blocked by snow,
and there was no remedy at hand. Mr. Dodd boldly undertook
a contract to remove the mighty obstruction in a given
time. This he did thoroughly and within the limited number
of days. Afterwards he appears to have undertaken brick-making
and other works on a very large scale. In the
opinion of Mr. Roach Smith, Mr. Dodd was the origin of
the "golden dustman" in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, whom every
reader of Dickens remembers as Mr. Nicodemus, <i>alias</i> Noddy
Boffin.</p>

<p>Speaking of Dickens's readings, our informant relates
a conversation with Charles Dickens's sixth son, Mr. Henry
Fielding Dickens. The former gentleman asked the latter
whose model he took?</p>

<p>"Oh, my father's," said Mr. Henry Dickens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would not take any man's model," said Mr. Roach
Smith, "I would take my own." And judging from the perfect
intonation and thoroughly musical rhythm of his voice, there
is no doubt whatever that his model, whoever it may have
been, was one of very high standard.</p>

<p>We have since learnt that Mr. Roach Smith is the President
of the Strood Elocution Society, an almost unique institution
of its kind. It has been established upwards of thirteen years;
and at the weekly meetings "the various readers are subjected
to an exhaustive and salutary criticism by the members
present." Mr. Roach Smith has always taken immense
interest in the progress of this Society. Miss Dickens occasionally
helped at the above meetings.</p>

<p>Mr. Roach Smith kindly favours us with the following
extract from the third and forthcoming volume of his <i>Retrospections</i>
with reference to the late Mr. J. H. Ball, of Strood,
which may appropriately be here introduced:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Although I have said that I was the gainer by our acquaintance,
yet now and then I had a chance of serving him.
Soon after the death of the great novelist, Charles Dickens,
and when people were speculating as to what would become
of his residence at Gad's Hill, Mr. Ball, wishing to purchase it,
commissioned me to call on the executrix, Miss Hogarth,
and offer ten thousand pounds, for which he had written
a cheque. I accordingly went, and sent in my card. Miss
Hogarth, fortunately, could not see me; she was hastening to
catch the train for London, the carriage being at the door,
and not a moment to be lost; but she would be happy to see
me on her return in a day or two. I then wrote to Mr.
Forster, the other executor; and received a reply that the
place was not for sale. I kept him ignorant of the sum that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Mr. Ball was willing to give, and thus saved my friend some
thousands of pounds, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the house and land were not
worth half the money."</p>

</div>

<p>After some further conversation with our kind octogenarian
friend, who insists on showing us hospitality notwithstanding
his sufferings from a trying illness, we take our departure
with many pleasant memories of our visit.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>
<p>We have, after one or two unsuccessful attempts, the good
fortune to meet with Mr. Stephen Steele, M.R.C.S. and L.S.A.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
of Bridge House, Esplanade, Strood, who was admitted a
member of the medical profession so far back as the year
1831, and has therefore been in practice nearly sixty years.
It will be remembered that this experienced surgeon was sent
for by Miss Hogarth, to see Dickens in his last illness. He
is good enough to go over and describe to us in graphic and
sympathetic language the whole of the circumstances attending
that sorrowful event. Previously to doing so, he gives us
some interesting details of his recollections of Charles Dickens.
Dr. Steele had occupied the onerous post of Chairman of the
Liberal Association at Rochester for thirty years, and believes
that in politics Dickens was a Liberal, for he frequently
prefaced his remarks in conversation with him on any subject
of passing interest by the expression, "We Liberals, you
know&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/i_262.png" width="337" height="400" alt="Frindsbury Church" title="" />

</div>

<p>As a matter of fact, Dickens discharged his conscience of
his political creed in the remarks which followed his address<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
as President of the Birmingham and Midland Institute,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> delivered
27th September, 1869, when he said&mdash;"My political
creed is contained in two articles, and has no reference to any
party or persons. My faith in the 'people governing' is, on
the whole, infinitesimal; my faith in the 'people governed'
is, on the whole, illimitable." At a subsequent visit to
Birmingham on the 6th January, 1870, when giving out the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
prizes at the Institute, he further emphasized his political
faith in these words:&mdash;"When I was here last autumn, I
made a short confession of my political faith&mdash;or perhaps, I
should better say, want of faith. It imported that I have
very little confidence in the people who govern us&mdash;please to
observe 'people' with a small 'p,'&mdash;but I have very great confidence
in the People whom they govern&mdash;please to observe
'People' with a large 'P.'"</p>

<p>A few days after Charles Dickens's first visit, my friend Mr.
Howard S. Pearson, Lecturer on English Literature at the
Institute, addressed a letter to him on the subject of the
remarks at the conclusion of his Presidential Address, and
promptly received in reply the following communication,
which Mr. Pearson kindly allows me to print, emphasizing his
(Dickens's) observations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"<span class="smcap">Gad's Hill Place</span>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Higham by Rochester, Kent</span>.</span><br />
"<i>Wednesday, 6th October, 1869.</i><br />
</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You are perfectly right in your construction of my
meaning at Birmingham. If a capital P be put to the word
People in its second use in the sentence, and not in its first,
I should suppose the passage next to impossible to be mistaken,
even if it were read without any reference to the whole
spirit of my speech and the whole tenor of my writings.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"Faithfully yours,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Charles Dickens</span>.<br />
</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">H. S. Pearson, Esquire.</span>"</p></div>

<p>Dr. Steele had dined several times at Gad's Hill Place, and
was impressed with Dickens's wonderful powers as a host. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
never absorbed the whole of the conversation to himself, but
listened attentively when his guests were speaking, and
endeavoured, as it were, to draw out any friends who were
not generally talkative. He liked each one to chat about his
own hobby in which he took most interest. Our informant
was also present at Gad's Hill Place at several theatrical
entertainments, and especially remembers some charades
being given. After the performance of the latter was over,
Dickens walked round among his guests in the drawing-room,
and enquired if any one could guess the "word." Says the
doctor, "We never seemed to do so, but there was always a
hearty laugh when we were told what it was. There was
a good deal of company at Gad's Hill at Christmas time."</p>

<p><i>&Agrave; propos</i> of private theatricals at Gad's Hill Place, Mr. T.
Edgar Pemberton, in <i>Charles Dickens and the Stage</i>, calls
attention to the fact that "Mr. Clarkson Stanfield's <i>Lighthouse</i>
Act drop subsequently decorated the walls of Gad's
Hill Place; and although it took the painter less than a
couple of days to execute, fetched a thousand guineas at the
famous Dickens Sale in 1870." A cloth painted for <i>The
Frozen Deep</i>, which was the next and last of these productions,
also had a foremost place in the Gad's Hill picture-gallery.</p>

<p>Dr. Steele mentions a conversation once with Dickens
about Gad's Hill and Shakespeare's description of it. He (the
doctor) considers that Shakespeare could not have described
it so accurately if he had not been there, and Dickens agreed
with him in this opinion. Possibly he may have stayed at the
"Plough," which was an inn on the same spot as, or close to,
the "Falstaff." The place must have been much wooded at
that time, and Shakespeare might have been there on his way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
to Dover. A note in the <i>Rochester and Chatham Journal</i>,
1883, states that "Shakespeare's company made a tour in
Sussex and Kent in the summer of 1597."</p>

<p>Dr. Steele, in common with his friend Charles Dickens,
strongly deprecated the action of certain parties in Rochester,
by voting at a public meeting something to this effect:&mdash;"That
the Theatre was an irreligious kind of institution, and,
in the opinion of the meeting, it ought to be closed."</p>

<p>The doctor observes that Dickens was not much of a
Church-goer. He went occasionally to Higham, and used
to give the vicar assistance for the poor and distressed.
Dickens and Miss Hogarth asked Dr. Steele to point
out objects of charity worthy of relief, and they gave him
money for distribution.</p>

<p>He remarks that Dickens did not care much about associating
with the local residents, going out to dinners, &amp;c.
Most of the principal people of Rochester would have been
glad of the honour of his presence as a guest, but he rarely
accepted invitations, preferring the quietude of home.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>As regards readings, our informant says he is under the
impression that Dickens must have had some lessons or hints
from some one of experience (possibly his friend Fechter, the
actor), as he noticed from time to time a regular improvement,
which was permanently maintained. On the subject of the
American War, he thinks Dickens's sympathies were decidedly
with the South. With respect to the American
Readings, Dr. Steele expresses his opinion that the excitement,
fatigue, and worry consequent thereon had considerably
shortened Dickens's life, if it had not pretty well killed him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
He considered him a most genial sort of man; "he always
looked you straight in the face when speaking."</p>

<p>Before referring to the closing chapter in Dickens's life, we
have some interesting talk respecting Venesection,&mdash;<i>&agrave; propos</i>
of that memorable occasion on the ice at Dingley Dell, when
"Mr. Benjamin Allen was holding a hurried consultation with
Mr. Bob Sawyer on the advisability of bleeding the company
generally, as an improving little bit of professional practice,"&mdash;and
Dr. Steele gives us his opinion thereon, and on some
points connected with the medical profession. He was a
student of Guy's and St. Thomas's Hospitals, and was under
the distinguished physicians Drs. Addison and Elliotson. He
considered the characters of Bob Sawyer and Ben Allen not
at all overdrawn. They were good representations of the
medical students of those days. He believed the practice of
Venesection commenced to be general about the year 1811,
for his father was a medical practitioner before him, and he
does not remember his (the father's) telling him that he
practised it before that time. Says our friend, "We used to
bleed regularly in my young days, and in cases of pneumonia
and convulsions we never thought of omitting to bleed.
We should have considered that to have done so would have
been a grave instance of irregular practice. And," he adds,
"I bleed in cases of convulsions now." The doctor did not
think well of the change at the time, but, speaking generally,
he says Venesection had had its turn, and has now given
place to other treatment.</p>

<p>The events in connection with the fatal illness of Dickens
are then touchingly related as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was sent for on Wednesday, the eighth of June, 1870, to
attend at Gad's Hill Place, and arrived about 6.30 p.m. I found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Dickens lying on the floor of the dining-room in a fit. He
was unconscious, and never moved. The servants brought
a couch down, on which he was placed. I applied clysters
and other remedies to the patient without effect. Miss
Hogarth, his sister-in-law, had already sent a telegram (by
the same messenger on horseback who summoned me) to
his old friend and family doctor, Mr. Frank Beard, who
arrived about midnight. He relieved me in attendance at
that time, and I came again in the morning. There was
unhappily no change in the symptoms, and stertorous breathing,
which had commenced before, now continued. In conversation
Miss Hogarth and the family expressed themselves
perfectly satisfied with the attendance of Mr. Beard
and myself. I said, 'That may be so, and we are much
obliged for your kind opinion; but we have a duty to perform,
not only to you, my dear madam, and the family of
Mr. Dickens, but also to the public. What will the public
say if we allow Charles Dickens to pass away without further
medical assistance? Our advice is to send for Dr. Russell
Reynolds.' Mr. Beard first made the suggestion.</p>

<p>"The family reiterated their expression of perfect satisfaction
with the treatment of Mr. Beard and myself, but immediately
gave way, Dr. Russell Reynolds was sent for, and
came in the course of the day. This eminent physician without
hesitation pronounced the case to be hopeless. He said
at once on seeing him, 'He cannot live.' And so it proved.
At a little past 6 o'clock on Thursday, the 9th of June, 1870,
Charles Dickens passed quietly away without a word&mdash;about
twenty-four hours after the seizure."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>
<img src="images/i_268.png" width="550" height="410" alt="Rochester: from Strood Pier:" title="" />
</div>

<p>Such is the simple narrative which the kind-hearted
octogenarian surgeon, whom it is a delightful pleasure to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
meet and converse with, communicates to us, and then
cordially wishes us "good-bye."</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>There is an annual pleasure fair at Strood, instituted, it is
said, so far back as the reign of Edward III. It takes place
during three days in the last week of August, and as it is
going on while we are on our tramp, we just look in for a
few minutes, the more especially as we were informed by Mr.
William Ball, and others who had seen him, that Dickens used
to be very fond of going there at times in an appropriate
disguise, where perhaps he may have seen the prototype of
the famous "Doctor Marigold." The fair is now held on a
large piece of waste ground near the Railway Station.
There are the usual set-out of booths, "Aunt Sallies,"
shooting-galleries, "Try your weight and strength, gentlemen"
machines, a theatre, with a tragedy and comedy both
performed in about an hour, and hot-sausage and gingerbread
stalls in abundance. But the deafening martial music
poured forth from a barrel-organ by means of a steam-engine,
belonging to the proprietor of a huge "Merry-go-round," and
the wet and muddy condition of the ground from the effects
of the recent thunderstorm, make us glad to get away.</p>


<div class='center'><br />A MYSTERIOUS DICKENS-ITEM.</div>

<p>Mr. C. D. Levy, Auctioneer, etc., of Strood, was good enough
to lend me what at first sight, and indeed for some time
afterwards, was supposed to be a most unique Dickens-item.
It came into his possession in this way. At the sale of
Charles Dickens's furniture and effects, which took place at
Gad's Hill in 1870, Mr. Levy was authorized by a customer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
to purchase Dickens's writing-desk, which, however, he was
unable to secure. In transferring the desk to the purchaser
at the time of the sale, a few old and torn papers
tumbled out, and being considered of no value, were disregarded
and scattered. One of these scraps was picked up by
Mr. Levy, and proved on further examination to be a sheet of
headed note-paper having the stamp of "Gad's Hill Place,
Higham by Rochester, Kent."&mdash;On the first page were a few
rough sketches drawn with pen and ink, which greatly resembled
some of the characters in <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>&mdash;Durdles,
Jasper, and Edwin Drood. At the side was a
curious row of capital letters looking like a puzzle. On the
second and third pages were short-hand notes, and on the
fourth page a few lines written in long-hand, continued on
the next page,&mdash;wonderfully like Charles Dickens's own
handwriting,&mdash;being the commencement of a speech with
reference to a cricket match. The sheet of paper had evidently
been made to do double duty, for after the sketches
had been drawn on the front page, the sheet was put aside,
and when used again was turned over, so that what ordinarily
would have been page 4 became page 1 for the second object.
No "Daniel" in Strood or Rochester had ever been able to
decipher the mysterious hieroglyphics, or make known the
interpretation thereof, during twenty years, or give any
explanation of the sketches. But everybody thought that in
some way or other they related to <i>The Mystery of Edwin
Drood</i>&mdash;and possibly contained a clue to the solution of that
exquisite fragment. So, as a student and admirer of Dickens,
Mr. Levy kindly left the matter in my hands to make out
what I could of it. Reference was accordingly had to several
learned pundits in the short-hand systems of "Pitman,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
"Odell," and "Harding," but without avail; and eventually
Mr. Gurney Archer, of 20, Abingdon Street, Westminster
(successor to the old-established and eminent firm of Messrs.
W. B. Gurney and Sons, who have been the short-hand writers
to the House of Lords from time immemorial), kindly transcribed
the short-hand notes, which referred to a speech
relating to a cricket match, a portion of which had already
been written out in long-hand, as above stated,&mdash;but there was
not a word in the short-hand about Edwin Drood!</p>

<p>So far, one portion of the mystery had been explained&mdash;not
so the sketches, which were still believed to contain the
key to <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>. As a <i>dernier ressort</i>,
application was made to the fountain-head&mdash;to Mr. Luke
Fildes, R.A., the famous illustrator of that beautiful work.
He received me most courteously, scrutinized the document
closely; we had a long chat about Edwin Drood generally,
the substance of which has been given in a previous chapter&mdash;but
he admitted that the sketches failed to give any solution
of the mystery.</p>

<p>The document was subsequently sent by Mr. Kitton to
Mrs. Perugini, who at once replied that it had caused some
merriment when she saw it again, as she remembered it very
well. It had been done by her brother, Mr. Henry Fielding
Dickens, when a young man living at home at Gad's Hill&mdash;that
the short-hand notes referred to his speech at a dinner
after one of the numerous cricket matches held there, and
that the sketches were rough portraits of some of the
cricketers. The capital letters at the side referred to a double
acrostic. The heads of the speech had been suggested by his
father as being desirable to be brought before the cricket club,
which at that time was in a rather drooping condition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Now although the original theory about this curious
document entirely broke down, and not an atom has been
added to what was already known about <i>The Mystery of
Edwin Drood</i>, still there is one subject of much interest which
the document has brought to light. The short-hand is the
same system, "Gurney's," as that which Charles Dickens
wrote as a reporter in his early newspaper days&mdash;a system
not generally used now, but which he subsequently taught
his son to write. Of the many sheets which Dickens covered
with notes in days gone by not one remains. But there are
two manuscripts by Dickens in Gurney's system of short-hand,
now in the Dyce and Forster collection at South Kensington,
which relate to some private matters in connection with publishing
arrangements. The document is certainly interesting
from this point of view (<i>i. e.</i> the system which Dickens used),
and from its reference to life at Gad's Hill, and especially to
cricket, the favourite game mentioned many times in this
book, in which the novelist took so much interest. Mr.
Henry Fielding Dickens, with whom I had on another
occasion some conversation on the subject of this souvenir
of his youth at Gad's Hill, remarked that many more
important issues had hung upon much more slender evidence.
It was done about the year 1865-6, before he went
to college.</p>

<p>At our interview Mr. H. F. Dickens told me the details of
the following touching incident which happened at one of the
cricket matches at Gad's Hill. His father was as usual attired
in flannels, acting as umpire and energetically taking the
score of the game, when there came out from among the
bystanders a tall, grizzled, and sun-burnt Sergeant of the
Guards. The Sergeant walked straight up to Mr. Dickens,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
saying, "May I look at you, sir?" "Oh, yes!" said the
novelist, blushing up to the eyes. The Sergeant gazed intently
at him for a minute or so, then stood at attention, gave the
military salute, and said, "God bless you, sir." He then
walked off and was seen no more. In recounting this
anecdote, Mr. H. F. Dickens agreed with me that, reading
between the lines, one can almost fancy some lingering
reminiscences similar to those in the early experience of
Private Richard Doubledick.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class="hang2"><b>CHATHAM:&mdash;ST. MARY'S CHURCH, ORDNANCE TERRACE,
THE HOUSE ON THE BROOK, THE MITRE HOTEL, AND
FORT PITT. LANDPORT:&mdash;PORTSEA, HANTS.</b><br /><br /></div>

<div class='hang2'>"The home of his infancy, to which his heart had yearned with an
intensity of affection not to be described."&mdash;<i>The Pickwick Papers.</i></div>

<div class="hang2">"I believe the power of observation in numbers of very young children to
be quite wonderful for its closeness and accuracy. Indeed, I think that
most grown men who are remarkable in this respect, may, with greater
propriety, be said not to have lost the faculty than to have acquired
it; the rather, as I generally observe such men to retain a certain
freshness, and gentleness, and capacity of being pleased, which are
also an inheritance they have preserved from their childhood."&mdash;<i>David
Copperfield.</i></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> naval and military town of Chatham, unlike the
Cathedral city of Rochester, has, at first sight, few attractions
for the lover of Dickens. Mr. Phillips Bevan calls it "a dirty,
unpleasant town devoted to the interests of soldiers, sailors,
and marines." We are not disposed to agree entirely with
him; but we must admit that it has little of the picturesque
to recommend it&mdash;no venerable Castle or Cathedral to attract
attention, no scenes in the novels of much importance to
visit, no characters therein of much interest to identify. Mr.
Pickwick's own description of the four towns of Strood,
Rochester, Chatham, and Brompton, certainly applies more
nearly to Chatham than to the others; but things have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
improved in many ways since the days of that veracious
chronicler, as we are glad to testify:&mdash;</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The principal productions of these towns," says Mr. Pickwick,
"appear to be soldiers, sailors, Jews, chalk, shrimps, officers, and
dockyard men. The commodities chiefly exposed for sale in the
public streets are marine stores, hard-bake, apples, flat-fish, and
oysters. The streets present a lively and animated appearance,
occasioned chiefly by the conviviality of the military.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"The consumption of tobacco in these towns," continues Mr.
Pickwick, "must be very great; and the smell which pervades the
streets must be exceedingly delicious to those who are extremely
fond of smoking. A superficial traveller might object to the dirt,
which is their leading characteristic; but to those who view it as an
indication of traffic and commercial prosperity, it is truly gratifying."</p></div>

<p>And yet for all this, there are circumstances to be noticed
of the deepest possible interest connected with Chatham, and
spots therein to be visited, which every pilgrim to "Dickens-Land"
must recognize. At Chatham,&mdash;"my boyhood's
home," as he affectionately calls it,&mdash;many of the earlier
years of Charles Dickens (probably from his fourth to his
eleventh) were passed; here it was "that the most durable
of his earlier impressions were received; and the associations
around him when he died were those which at the outset of
his life had affected him most strongly."</p>

<p>Admirers of the great novelist are much indebted to Mr.
Robert Langton, F. R. Hist. Soc., for his <i>Childhood and Youth
of Charles Dickens</i>, a book quite indispensable to a tramp in
this neighbourhood, the charming illustrations by the late Mr.
William Hull, the author, and others rendering the identification
of places perfectly easy. Dickens says, "If anybody
knows to a nicety where Rochester ends and Chatham begins,
it is more than I do." "It's of no consequence," as Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Toots would say, for the High Street is one continuous
thoroughfare, but as a matter of fact, a narrow street called
Boundary Lane on the north side of High Street separates
the two places.</p>

<p>A few words of recapitulation as to early family history<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
may be useful here. John Dickens, who is represented as "a
fine portly man," was a Navy pay-clerk, and Elizabeth his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
wife (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Barrow), who is described as "a dear good mother
and a fine woman," the parents of the future genius, resided in
the beginning of this century at 387, Mile End Terrace, Commercial
Road, Landport, Portsea,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> "and is so far in Portsea as
being in the island of that name." Here Charles Dickens was
born, at twelve o'clock at night, on Friday, 7th February,
1812. He was the second child and eldest son of a rather
numerous family consisting of eight sons and daughters, and
was baptized at St. Mary's, Kingston (the parish church of
Portsea), under the names of Charles John Huff<i>h</i>am; the
last of these is no doubt a misspelling, as the name of his
grandfather, from whom he took it, was Huffam, but Dickens
himself scarcely ever used it. In the old family Bible now in
possession of Mr. Charles Dickens it is Huffam in his father's
own handwriting. The Dickens family left Mile End Terrace
on 24th June, 1812, and went to live in Hawke Street, Portsea,
from whence, in consequence of a change in official duties of
the elder Dickens, they removed to Chatham in 1816 or 1817,
and resided there for six or seven years, until they went to
live in London.</p>

<p>Bearing these circumstances in mind, it is very natural that
we should determine on an early pilgrimage to Chatham, and
Sunday morning sees us at the old church&mdash;St. Mary's&mdash;where
Dickens himself must often have been taken as a child, and
where he saw the marriage of his aunt Fanny with James
Lamert, a Staff Doctor in the Army,&mdash;the Doctor Slammer
of <i>Pickwick</i>,&mdash;of whom Mr. Langton says:&mdash;"The regimental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
surgeon's kindly manner, and his short odd way of expressing
himself, still survive in the recollections of a few old people."
Dr. Lamert's son James, by a former wife, was a great crony
of young Charles Dickens, taking him to the Rochester
theatre, and getting up private theatricals in which they both
acted.</p>

<p>Surely there is a faint description of those times in the
second chapter of <i>David Copperfield:</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">St. Mary&#39;s Church, Chatham.</span>
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Here is our pew in the church. What a high-backed pew! With
a window near it, out of which our house can be seen, and <i>is</i> seen
many times during the morning's service by Peggotty, who likes to
make herself as sure as she can that it's not being robbed, or is not
in flames. But though Peggotty's eye wanders, she is much offended
if mine does, and frowns to me, as I stand upon the seat, that I am
to look at the clergyman. But I can't always look at him&mdash;I know
him without that white thing on, and I am afraid of his wondering
why I stare so, and perhaps stopping the service to enquire&mdash;and
what am I to do? It's a dreadful thing to gape, but I must do
something. I look at my mother, but <i>she</i> pretends not to see me. I
look at a boy in the aisle, and <i>he</i> makes faces at me. I look at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
sunlight coming in at the open door through the porch, and there I
see a stray sheep&mdash;I don't mean a sinner, but mutton&mdash;half making
up his mind to come into the church. I feel that if I looked at him
any longer, I might be tempted to say something out loud; and
what would become of me then!"</p></div>

<p>The church, now undergoing reconstruction, is not a very
presentable structure, and has little of interest to recommend
it, except a brass to a famous navigator named Stephen
Borough, the discoverer of the northern passage to Russia
(1584), and a monument to Sir John Cox, who was killed in
an action with the Dutch (1672). The name of Weller occurs
on a gravestone near the church door.</p>

<p>We cross the High Street, proceed along Railway Street,
formerly Rome Lane, pass the Chatham Railway Station
(near which is a statue of Lieutenant Waghorn, R.N., "pioneer
and founder of the Overland Route," born at Chatham, 1800,
and died 1850),<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and find ourselves at Ordnance Terrace, a
conspicuous row of two-storied houses, prominently situated
on the higher ground facing us, beyond the Station. In one
of these houses (No. 11&mdash;formerly No. 2) the Dickens family
resided from 1817 to 1821. The present occupier is a Mr.
Roberts, who kindly allows us to inspect the interior. It has
the dining-room on the left-hand side of the entrance and the
drawing-room on the first floor, and is altogether a pleasantly-situated,
comfortable, and respectable dwelling. No. 11, "the
second house in the terrace," is overgrown with a Virginia
creeper, which, from its possible association with Dickens's
earliest years, may have induced him to plant the now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
magnificent one which exists at Gad's Hill. "Here it was,"
says Forster, "that his first desire for knowledge, and his
greatest passion for reading, were awakened by his mother,
who taught him the first rudiments, not only of English, but
also, a little later, of Latin. She taught him regularly every
day for a long time, and taught him, he was convinced,
thoroughly well." Mr. Langton also says that "It was
during his residence here that some of the happiest hours of
the childhood of little Charles were passed, as his father was
in a fairly good position in the Navy Pay Office, and they
were a most genial, lovable family." Here it was that the
theatrical entertainments and the genial parties took place,
when, in addition to his brothers and sisters and his cousin,
James Lamert, there were also present his friends and
neighbours, George Stroughill, and Master and Miss Tribe.</p>

<span class="caption">No. 11, Ordnance Terrace, Chatham. &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Where the Dickens Family lived 1817-21.</i></span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Langton further states that "Ordnance Terrace is known
to have formed the locality and characters for some of the
earlier <i>Sketches by Boz</i>." "The Old Lady" was a Miss
Newnham, who lived at No. 5, and who was, by all accounts,
very kind to the Dickens children. The "Half-pay Captain"
was also a near neighbour, and he is supposed to have supplied
one of the earliest characters to Dickens as a mere child.
Some of the neighbours at the corner house next door
(formerly No. 1) were named Stroughill,&mdash;pronounced Stro'hill
(there was, it will be remembered, a <i>Struggles</i> at the
famous cricket-match at All-Muggleton)&mdash;and the son, George,
is said to have had some of the characteristics of Steerforth in
<i>David Copperfield</i>. He had a sister named Lucy, probably
the "Golden Lucy," from her beautiful locks, and who, according
to Mr. Langton, "was the special favourite and little
sweetheart of Charles Dickens." She was possibly the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
prototype of her namesake, in the beautiful story of the
<i>Wreck of the Golden Mary</i>.</p>


<p>About the year 1821 pecuniary embarrassments beset and
tormented the Dickens family, which were afterwards to be
"ascribed in fiction" in the histories of the Micawbers and the
Dorrits, and the family removed to the House on the Brook.
In order to follow their steps in perfect sequence, we have to
return by the way we came from the church, cross the High
Street, and proceed along Military Road, so as to visit the
obscure dwelling, No. 18, St. Mary's Place, situated in the
valley through which a brook, now covered over, flows from
the higher lands adjacent, into the Medway.</p>

<span class="caption">Giles&#39;s School, Chatham.</span>
</div>

<p>The House on the Brook&mdash;"plain-looking, whitewashed
plaster front, and a small garden before and behind"&mdash;next
door to the former Providence (Baptist) Chapel, now the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Drill Hall of the Salvation Army, is a very humble and unpretentious
six-roomed dwelling, and of a style very different
to the one in Ordnance Terrace. Here the Dickens family
lived from 1821 to 1823. The Reverend William Giles, the
Baptist Minister, father of Mr. William Giles, the schoolmaster,
formerly officiated at the chapel. This was the Mr.
Giles who, when Dickens was half-way through <i>Pickwick</i>,
sent him a silver snuff-box, with an admiring inscription to
the "Inimitable Boz." Dickens went to school at Mr. Giles's
Academy in Clover Lane (now Clover Street), Chatham,
and boys of this and neighbouring schools were thus
nicknamed:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Baker's Bull-dogs,<br />
"Giles's Cats,<br />
"New Road Scrubbers,<br />
"Troy Town Rats."<br />
</div>


<p>It was in the House on the Brook that he acquired those
"readings and imaginings" which in "boyish recollections"
he describes as having been brought away from Chatham:&mdash;"My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
father had left a small collection of books in a little
room up-stairs, to which I had access (for it adjoined my own),
and which nobody else in our house ever troubled. From
that blessed little room <i>Roderick Random</i>, <i>Peregrine Pickle</i>,
<i>Humphry Clinker</i>, <i>Tom Jones</i>, <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>, <i>Don
Quixote</i>, <i>Gil Blas</i>, and <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, came out, a glorious
host to keep me company. They kept alive my fancy, and
my hope of something beyond that place and time,&mdash;they and
the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, and the <i>Tales of the Genii</i>,&mdash;and did me
no harm; for whatever harm was in some of them was not
there for me. <i>I</i> knew nothing of it."</p>

<p>It is very probable that his first literary effort, <i>The Tragedy
of Misnar, the Sultan of India</i>, "founded" (says Forster), "and
very literally founded, no doubt, on the <i>Tales of the Genii</i>,"
was composed after perusal of some of the works above
referred to, but it is to be feared that it was never even
rehearsed. The circumstances of the family had so changed
for the worse, that here were neither juvenile parties nor
theatrical entertainments.</p>

<p>A view from one of the upper windows of the house in
St. Mary's Place gives the parish church and churchyard
precisely as described in that pathetic little story, <i>A
Child's Dream of a Star</i>. Charles Dickens was the child who
"strolled about a good deal, and thought of a number
of things," and his little sister Fanny&mdash;or his younger sister
Harriet Ellen&mdash;was doubtless "his constant companion"
referred to in the story.</p>


<p>We leave with feelings of respect the humble but famous
little tenement, its condition now sadly degraded; proceed
along the High Street, and soon reach "The Mitre Inn and
Clarence Hotel," a solid-looking and comfortable house of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
entertainment, at which Lord Nelson and King William IV.,
when Duke of Clarence, frequently stayed, and (what is more
to our purpose) where we find associations of Charles Dickens.
There are a beautiful bowling-green and grounds at the back,
approached by a series of terraces well planted with flowers,
and the green is surrounded by fine elms which constitute
quite an oasis in the desert of the somewhat prosaic Chatham.
The Mitre is thus immortalized in the "Guest's Story" of the
<i>Holly Tree Inn:</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_286.png" width="400" height="274" alt="Mitre Inn, Chatham." title="" />
<span class="caption">Mitre Inn, Chatham.</span>
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There was an Inn in the Cathedral town where I went to school,
which had pleasanter recollections about it than any of these. I took
it next. It was the Inn where friends used to put up, and where we
used to go to see parents, and to have salmon and fowls, and be
tipped. It had an ecclesiastical sign&mdash;the 'Mitre'&mdash;and a bar that
seemed to be the next best thing to a Bishopric, it was so snug. I
loved the landlord's youngest daughter to distraction&mdash;but let that
pass. It was in this Inn that I was cried over by my rosy little sister,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
because I had acquired a black-eye in a fight. And though she had
been, that holly-tree night, for many a long year where all tears are
dried, the Mitre softened me yet."</p></div>

<p>About the year 1820 the landlord of the Mitre was Mr.
John Tribe, and his family being intimate with the Dickenses,
young Charles spent many pleasant evenings at the "genial
parties" given at this fine old inn. Mr. Langton mentions that
the late Mr. Alderman William Tribe, son of Mr. John Tribe,
the former proprietor, perfectly recollected Charles Dickens
and his sister Fanny coming to the Mitre, and on one
occasion their being mounted on a dining-table for a stage,
and singing what was then a popular duet, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Long time I've courted you, miss,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And now I've come from sea;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We'll make no more ado, miss,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But quickly married be.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Sing Fal-de-ral," &amp;c.</span><br />
</div>

<p>The worthy alderman is also stated to have had in his
possession a card of invitation to spend the evening at
Ordnance Terrace, addressed from Master and Miss Dickens
to Master and Miss Tribe, which was dated about this
time.</p>

<p>In consequence of the elder Dickens being recalled from
Chatham to Somerset House, to comply with official requirements,
the family removed to London in 1823,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> "and took
up its abode in a house in Bayham Street, Camden Town."
Dickens thus describes his journey to London in "Dullborough
Town," one of the sketches in <i>The Uncommercial Traveller:</i>&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"As I left Dullborough in the days when there were no railroads
in the land, I left it in a stage-coach. Through all the years that
have since passed, have I ever lost the smell of the damp straw in
which I was packed&mdash;like game&mdash;and forwarded, carriage paid, to the
Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London? There was no other
inside passenger, and I consumed my sandwiches in solitude and
dreariness, and it rained hard all the way, and I thought life sloppier
than I had expected to find it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p></div>

<p>Mr. W. T. Wildish, the proprietor of the <i>Rochester and
Chatham Journal</i>, kindly favours us with some interesting
information which has recently appeared in his journal,
relating to Charles Dickens's nurse&mdash;the Mary Weller of his
boyhood (and perhaps the Peggotty as well), but known
to later generations as Mrs. Mary Gibson of Front Row,
Ordnance Place, Chatham, who died in the spring of the
year 1888, at the advanced age of eighty-four. Very touchingly,
but unknowingly, did Dickens write from Gad's
Hill, 24th September, 1857, being unaware that she was
still living:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I feel much as I used to do when I was a small child, a
few miles off, and somebody&mdash;<i>who</i>, I wonder, and which way
did <i>she</i> go when she died?&mdash;hummed the evening hymn, and I
cried on the pillow&mdash;either with the remorseful consciousness
of having kicked somebody else, or because still somebody
else had hurt my feelings in the course of the day."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gibson, when Mary Weller (what a host of pleasant
recollections does the married name of the "pretty housemaid"
bring up of the Pickwickian days!), lived with the family of
Mr. John Dickens, at No. 11, Ordnance Terrace, Chatham,
and afterwards when they moved to the House on the
Brook. Her recollections were most vivid and interesting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
According to the testimony of her son, communicated to Mr.
Wildish, Mrs. Gibson "used to be very fond of talking of the
time she passed with the Dickens family, and one of her
highest satisfactions in her later years was to hear Charles
Dickens's works read by her son Robert; and while listening
to the descriptions of characters read to her, his mother would
detect likenesses unsuspected by other persons whom Dickens
must have known when a boy; and she also agreed in thinking,
with Dickens's biographer, that in Mr. Micawber's troubles
were related some of the experiences of the elder Dickens,
who is believed for a time to have occupied a debtor's prison.
She, however, would never bring herself to believe that her
hero was himself ever reduced to such great hardships as the
blacking-bottle period in <i>David Copperfield</i> would suggest if
taken literally. She used to speak of the future author as
always fond of reading, and said he was wont to retire to the
top room of the House on the Brook, and spend what should
have been his play-hours in poring over his books, or in acting
to the furniture of the room the creatures that he had read
about."</p>

<p>Mr. Langton, who had a personal interview with Mrs.
Gibson herself, has recorded the fact that she well remembered
singing the Evening Hymn to the children of John Dickens,
and seemed very much surprised at being asked such a
question. She lived with the family when Dickens's little
sister, Harriet Ellen, died&mdash;a circumstance that no doubt in
after years inspired the <i>Child's Dream of a Star</i> already
referred to. When the family removed to London, Mary
Weller was pressed to accompany them, but was not in
a position to accept the offer, in consequence of her promise
to marry Mr. Thomas Gibson, a shipwright of the Chatham<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Dockyard, with whom she lived happily until his death, in
1886, at the age of eighty-two.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gibson modestly declined, on her son Robert's suggestion,
to seek an introduction to Charles Dickens, when he
read some of his works at the old Mechanics' Institute at
Chatham, fearing that he had forgotten her. It is certain,
however, that, from the reproduction of her name as the pretty
housemaid at Mr. Nupkins's at Ipswich, and from the extract
from the letter above referred to, she had a kindly place in
his recollections.</p>

<p>Poor David Copperfield, on his way to his aunt's at Dover,
stopped at Chatham&mdash;"footsore and tired," he says, "and
eating bread that I had bought for supper." He is afraid
"because of the vicious looks of the trampers;" and even if he
could have spared the few pence he possessed for a bed at the
"one or two little houses" with the notice "lodgings for travellers,"
he would have hardly cared to go in, on account of the
company he would have been thrown into. And so he says,
"I sought no shelter, therefore, but the sky; and toiling into
Chatham&mdash;which, in that night's aspect, is a mere dream of
chalk, and draw-bridges, and mastless ships in a muddy river,
roofed like Noah's arks,&mdash;crept, at last, upon a sort of grass-grown
battery overhanging a lane, where a sentry was walking
to and fro. Here" [he continues] "I lay down near a cannon;
and, happy in the society of the sentry's footsteps, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. slept
soundly until morning." Of course it is not possible for us to
identify this spot. "Very stiff and sore of foot," he says, "I
was in the morning, and quite dazed by the beating of drums
and marching of troops, which seemed to hem me in on every
side when I went down towards the long narrow street."
However, he has to reserve his strength for getting to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
journey's end, and to this effect he resolves upon selling his
jacket.</p>

<p>There are plenty of marine-store dealers at Chatham, whom
we notice on our tramp, but none of them would, we believe,
now answer to the description of "an ugly old man, with the
lower part of his face all covered with a stubbly grey beard,
in a filthy flannel waistcoat, and smelling terribly of rum,"
such as he who assailed little David, in reply to his offer to
sell the jacket, with, "Oh, what do you want? Oh, my eyes
and limbs, what do you want? Oh, my lungs and liver,
what do you want? Oh&mdash;goroo, goroo!" After losing his
time, and being rated at and frightened by this "dreadful old
man to look at," who in every way tries to avoid giving him
the money asked for,&mdash;half-a-crown,&mdash;offering him in exchange
such useless things to a hungry boy as "a fishing-rod,
a fiddle, a cocked hat, and a flute," the poor lad is obliged
to close with the offer of a few pence, "with which [he says]
I soon refreshed myself completely; and, being in better
spirits then, limped seven miles upon my road."</p>

<p>The Convict Prison at Chatham is said to have been built
on a piece of ground which, in the middle of the last century,
belonged to one Thomas Clark, a singular character, who lived
on the spot for many years by himself in a small cottage, and
who used every night, as he went home, to sing or shout,
"Tom's all alone! Tom's all alone!" This, according to
the opinion of some, may have given rise to the "Tom all
alone's" of <i>Bleak House</i>, more especially considering the fact
that military operations were frequently going on at Chatham,
which Dickens would notice in his early days. The circumstance
is thus referred to in the novel:&mdash;"Twice lately there
has been a crash, and a crowd of dust, like the springing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of a mine, in Tom all alone's, and each time a house has
fallen."</p>

<p>Mr. George Robinson of Strood directs our attention to the
fact that a "child's caul," such as that described in the first
chapter of <i>David Copperfield</i>, which he was born with, and
which was advertised "at the low price of fifteen guineas,"
would be a likely object to be sought after in a sea-faring
town like Chatham, in Dickens's early days, when the schoolmaster
was less abroad than he is now.</p>

<p>In after years, memories of Chatham Dockyard appear in
many of the sketches in the <i>Uncommercial Traveller</i> and
other stories. "One man in a Dockyard" describes it as having
"a gravity upon its red brick offices and houses, a staid
pretence of having nothing to do, an avoidance of display,
which I never saw out of England." "Nurse's Stories" says
that "nails and copper are shipwrights' sweethearts, and shipwrights
will run away with them whenever they can." In
<i>Great Expectations</i> the refrain, "Beat it out, beat it out&mdash;old
Clem! with a clink for the stout&mdash;old Clem!" which Pip and
his friends sang, is from a song which the blacksmiths in the
dockyard used to sing in procession on St. Clement's Day.</p>

<p>By accident we make the acquaintance of Mr. William James
Budden of Chatham, who informs us that Charles Dickens
was better known there in his latter years for his efforts, by
readings and otherwise, to place the Mechanics' Institute on
a sound basis and free from debt.</p>

<p>Dickens, as the <i>Uncommercial Traveller</i>, thus describes the
Mechanics' Institute and its early efforts to succeed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As the town was placarded with references to the Dullborough
Mechanics' Institution, I thought I would go and look at that establishment
next. There had been no such thing in the town in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
young days, and it occurred to me that its extreme prosperity might
have brought adversity upon the Drama. I found the Institution
with some difficulty, and should scarcely have known that I had
found it if I had judged from its external appearance only; but this
was attributable to its never having been finished, and having no
front: consequently, it led a modest and retired existence up a stable-yard.
It was (as I learnt, on enquiry) a most flourishing Institution,
and of the highest benefit to the town: two triumphs which I was
glad to understand were not at all impaired by the seeming
drawbacks that no mechanics belonged to it, and that it was steeped
in debt to the chimney-pots. It had a large room, which was approached
by an infirm step-ladder: the builder having declined to
construct the intended staircase, without a present payment in cash,
which Dullborough (though profoundly appreciative of the Institution)
seemed unaccountably bashful about subscribing."</p></div>

<p>Mr. Budden is of opinion that the origin of the "fat boy"
in <i>Pickwick</i> was Mr. James Budden, late of the Red Lion
Inn in Military Road, who afterwards acquired a competence,
and who had the honour of entertaining Dickens at a
subsequent period of his life. Mr. Budden is under the
impression, from local hearsay, that Dingley Dell formerly
existed somewhere in the neighbourhood of Burham.</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>We are obligingly favoured with an interview by Mr. John
Baird of New Brompton, Chairman of the Chatham Waterworks
Company, although he is suffering from serious
indisposition at the time of our visit. This gentleman was
born in 1810 (two years before Charles Dickens), and recollects
reading with delight the famous <i>Sketches by Boz</i>, as
they appeared in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>. The most curious
coincidence about Mr. Baird is, that in stature and facial
appearance he is the very counterpart of the late Charles
Dickens in the flesh&mdash;his double, so to speak. This remarkable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
resemblance, our informant says, is "something to be
proud of, to be mistaken for so great a man, but it was very
inconvenient at times."</p>

<p>On one occasion, as Mr. Baird was hastening to catch a
train at Rochester Bridge Station, a stout elderly lady,
handsomely dressed, supposed to be Dean Scott's wife,&mdash;but
to whom he was unknown,&mdash;bowed very politely to him, and
in slackening his pace to return the compliment, which he
naturally did not understand, he very nearly missed his train.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Otway told Mr. Baird that the Rev. Mr.
Webster, late Vicar of Chatham, had always mistaken him
for Charles Dickens.</p>

<p>At one of the Readings given by Dickens on behalf of the
Mechanics' Institute at Chatham, Mr. Charles Collins, his son-in-law,
and his wife and her sister being present in the reserved
seats in the gallery, Mr. Baird noticed that they looked very
eagerly at him, and this pointed notice naturally made him
feel very uncomfortable. Dickens himself, accompanied by
his son and daughter, once passed our friend in the street,
and scanned him very closely, and he fancies that Dickens
called attention to the resemblance.</p>

<p>At the last reading which the novelist gave at Chatham,
Mr. Baird being present as one of the audience, the policeman
at the door mistook him for Dickens, and shouted to those
in attendance outside, "Mr. Dickens's carriage!" It is
interesting to add, that after the reading a cordial vote of
thanks to Dickens was proposed by Mr. H. G. Adams, the
Naturalist, at one time editor of <i>The Kentish Coronal</i>, who
recounted the well-known story of the novelist's father taking
him, when a little boy, to see Gad's Hill Place, and of the
strong impression it made upon his mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Our informant had the honour of meeting Dickens at dinner
at Mr. James Budden's, and states that he was standing
against the mantel-piece in the drawing-room when the novelist
arrived, and that he walked up to him and shook hands
cordially, without the usual ceremony of introduction.
Dickens was no doubt too polite to refer to the curious
resemblance.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable case remains to be told, illustrating
the converse of the old proverb&mdash;"It is a wise father
that knows his own child." This is given in Mr. Baird's own
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My daughter, when a little girl about six years old, was
with her mother and some friends in a railway carriage at
Strood station (next Rochester), and one of them called the
child's attention to a gentleman standing on the platform,
asking if she knew who he was. With surprised delight she
at once exclaimed, 'That's my papa!' That same gentleman
was Mr. Charles Dickens!"</p>

<p>Mr. Baird speaks of the great appreciation which the people
of Chatham had of Dickens's services at the readings, and
says it was very good and kind of him to give those services
gratuitously. He confirms the general opinion as to the
origin of the "fat boy," and the "very fussy little man" at
Fort Pitt, who was the prototype of Dr. Slammer.</p>

<p>It struck us both forcibly that Mr. Baird's appearance at
the time of our visit was very like the last American photograph
of Dickens, taken by Gurney in 1867.</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>Mr. J. E. Littlewood<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of High Street, Chatham, knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Charles Dickens about the year 1845 or 1846 at the Royalty
(Miss Kelly's) Theatre in Dean Street, Soho, our informant
having been in times past a bit of an amateur actor, and
played Bob Acres in <i>The Rivals</i>. He subsequently heard
Dickens read at the Chatham Mechanics' Institute about 1861,
and said that the facial display in the trial scene from
<i>Pickwick</i> (one of the pieces read) was wonderful. He had
the honour of dining at the late Mr. Budden's in High Street,
opposite Military Road, to meet Dickens. There was a large
company present. In acknowledging the toast of his health,
which had been proposed at the dinner&mdash;either by Sir Arthur
Otway or Captain Fanshawe&mdash;Dickens said he was very
pleased to read "in memory of the old place," meaning
Chatham, but that he might be reading "all the year round"
for charities.</p>

<p>Mr. Littlewood also heard Dickens say, that "he had passed
many happy hours in the House on the Brook" looking at
"the Lines" opposite. "At that time" (said our informant)
"the place was more rural&mdash;considered a decent spot&mdash;not so
crowded up as now&mdash;nor so vulgar&mdash;many respectable people
lived there in Dickens's boyhood. The place has sadly
changed since for the worse."</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>Mr. Humphrey Wood, Solicitor, of Chatham, was, about
the year 1867, local Hon. Secretary to the Royal Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and, having applied to
Charles Dickens to give a Reading on behalf of the Society,
received the following polite answer to his application. If
only a few words had to be said, they were well said and
to the purpose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Like other towns in Kent, Chatham contains many names
which are suggestive of some of Dickens's characters, <i>viz.</i>
Dowler, Whiffen, Kimmins, Wyles, Arkcoll, Perse, Winch,
Wildish, Hockaday, Mowatt, Hunnisett, and others.</p>

<p>It is, of course, scarcely necessary to mention, in passing,
that Chatham is one of the most important centres of ship-building
for the Royal Navy; the dockyards&mdash;often referred
to in Dickens's minor works&mdash;cover more than seventy acres,
and are most interesting. Here, at the Navy Pay-Office,
the elder Dickens was employed during his residence at
Chatham.</p>

<p>Fort Pitt next claims our attention. It stands on the high
ground above the Railway Station at Chatham, just beyond
Ordnance Terrace. In Charles Dickens's early days, and
indeed long after, until the establishment of the magnificent
Institution at Netley, Fort Pitt was the principal military
Hospital in England, and was visited by Her Majesty during
the Crimean War. It is still used as a hospital, and contains
about two hundred and fifty beds. The interesting museum
which previously existed there has been removed to Netley.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>From Fort Pitt we see the famous "Chatham lines," which
constitute the elaborate and almost impregnable fortifications
of this important military and ship-building town. The
"lines" were commenced as far back as 1758, and stretch
from Gillingham to Brompton, a distance of several miles,
enclosing the peninsula formed by the bend of the river
Medway. Forster says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_298.png" width="400" height="284" alt="Navy Pay-Office, Chatham." title="" />
<span class="caption">Navy Pay-Office, Chatham.</span>
</div>

<p>"By Rochester and the Medway to the Chatham lines was
a favourite walk with Charles Dickens. He would turn out
of Rochester High Street through the Vines, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. would pass
round by Fort Pitt, and coming back by Frindsbury would
bring himself by some cross-fields again into the high-road."</p>

<p>The Chatham lines are locally understood as referring to a
piece of ground about three or four hundred yards square, near
Fort Pitt, used as an exercising-ground for the military.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Chapter IV. of <i>Pickwick</i>, "describing a field day and
bivouac," refers to the Chatham lines as the place where the
review was held, on the third day of the visit of the Pickwickians
to this neighbourhood, and which (having been
relieved of the company of their quondam friend, Mr. Jingle,
who had caused at least one of the party so much anxiety)
they all attended, possibly at Mr. Pickwick's suggestion, as
he is stated to have been "an enthusiastic admirer of the
army." The programme is thus referred to:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The whole population of Rochester and the adjoining towns,
rose from their beds at an early hour of the following morning, in a
state of the utmost bustle and excitement. A grand review was to
take place upon the lines. The man&oelig;uvres of half a dozen regiments
were to be inspected by the eagle eye of the commander-in-chief;
temporary fortifications had been erected, the citadel was to be
attacked and taken, and a mine was to be sprung."</p></div>

<p>The evolutions of this "ceremony of the utmost grandeur
and importance" proceed. Mr. Pickwick and his two friends
(Mr. Tupman "had suddenly disappeared, and was nowhere
to be found"), who are told to keep back, get hustled and
pushed by the crowd, and the unoffending Mr. Snodgrass, who
is in "the very extreme of human torture," is derided and
asked "vere he vos a shovin' to." Subsequently they get
hemmed in by the crowd, "are exposed to a galling fire of
blank cartridges, and harassed by the operations of the
military." Mr. Pickwick loses his hat, and not only regains
that useful article of dress, but finds the lost Mr. Tupman,
and the Pickwickians make the acquaintance of old Wardle
and his hospitable family from Dingley Dell, by whom they
are heartily entertained, and from whom they receive a warm
invitation to visit Manor Farm on the morrow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a fine view of Chatham and Rochester from the
fields round Fort Pitt, and on a bright sunny morning the air
coming over from the Kentish Hills is most refreshing, very
different indeed to what it was on a certain evening in Mr.
Winkle's life, when "a melancholy wind sounded through the
deserted fields like a giant whistling for his house-dog." We
ramble about for an hour or more, and in imagination call
up the pleasant times which Charles Dickens, as a boy, spent
here.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">Fort Pitt, Chatham.</span>
</div>

<p>Almost every inch of the ground must have been gone over
by him. What a delightful "playing-field" this and the
neighbouring meadows must have been to him and his young
companions, before the railway and the builder took possession
of some of the lower portions of the hill which forms
the base of Fort Pitt. "Here," says Mr. Langton, "is the
place where the schools of Rochester and Chatham used to
meet to settle their differences, and to contend in the more
friendly rivalry of cricket," and no doubt Dickens frequently
played when "Joe Specks" in Dullborough "kept wicket."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
In after life the memory of the past came back to Dickens
with all its freshness, when he again visited the neighbourhood
as the <i>Uncommercial Traveller</i> in "Dullborough":&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"With this tender remembrance upon me" [that of leaving
Chatham as a boy], "I was cavalierly shunted back into Dullborough
the other day, by train. My ticket had been previously collected,
like my taxes, and my shining new portmanteau had had a great
plaster stuck upon it, and I had been defied by Act of Parliament to
offer an objection to anything that was done to it, or me, under a
penalty of not less than forty shillings or more than five pounds,
compoundable for a term of imprisonment. When I had sent my
disfigured property on to the hotel, I began to look about me; and
the first discovery I made, was, that the Station had swallowed up the
playing-field.</p>

<p>"It was gone. The two beautiful hawthorn-trees, the hedge, the
turf, and all those buttercups and daisies, had given place to the
stoniest of jolting roads; while, beyond the Station, an ugly dark
monster of a tunnel kept its jaws open, as if it had swallowed them
and were ravenous for more destruction. The coach that had
carried me away, was melodiously called Timpson's Blue-eyed Maid,
and belonged to Timpson, at the coach-office up street; the locomotive
engine that had brought me back was called severely No. 97,
and belonged to S.E.R., and was spitting ashes and hot-water over
the blighted ground.</p>

<p>"When I had been let out at the platform-door, like a prisoner
whom his turnkey grudgingly released, I looked in again over the
low wall, at the scene of departed glories. Here, in the haymaking
time, had I been delivered from the dungeons of Seringapatam, an
immense pile (of haycock), by my countrymen, the victorious British
(boy next door and his two cousins), and had been recognized with
ecstasy by my affianced one (Miss Green), who had come all the way
from England (second house in the terrace) to ransom me, and
marry me."</p></div>

<p>Fort Pitt must have had considerable attractions in Mr.
Pickwick's time, as it would appear that it was visited by him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and his friends on the first day of their arrival at Rochester.
Lieutenant Tappleton (Dr. Slammer's second), when presenting
the challenge for the duel, thus speaks to Mr. Winkle in
the second chapter of <i>Pickwick:</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'You know Fort Pitt?'</p>

<p>"'Yes; I saw it yesterday.'</p>

<p>"'If you will take the trouble to turn into the field which borders
the trench, take the foot-path to the left, when you arrive at an angle
of the fortification; and keep straight on till you see me; I will
precede you to a secluded place, where the affair can be conducted
without fear of interruption.'</p>

<p>"'<i>Fear</i> of interruption!' thought Mr. Winkle."</p></div>

<p>Everybody remembers how the meeting took place on Fort
Pitt. Mr. Winkle, attended by his friend Mr. Snodgrass,
as second, is punctuality itself.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'We are in excellent time,' said Mr. Snodgrass, as they climbed
the fence of the first field; 'the sun is just going down.' Mr.
Winkle looked up at the declining orb, and painfully thought of the
probability of his 'going down' himself, before long."</p></div>

<p>Presently the officer appears, "the gentleman in the blue
cloak," and "slightly beckoning with his hand to the two
friends, they follow him for a little distance," and after
climbing a paling and scaling a hedge, enter a secluded
field.</p>

<p>Dr. Slammer is already there with his friend Dr. Payne,&mdash;Dr.
Payne of the 43rd, "the man with the camp-stool."</p>

<p>The arrangements proceed, when suddenly a check is
experienced.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'What's all this?' said Dr. Slammer, as his friend and Mr.
Snodgrass came running up.&mdash;'That's not the man.'</p>

<p>"'Not the man!' said Dr. Slammer's second.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Not the man!' said Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>"'Not the man!' said the gentleman with the camp-stool in his
hand.</p>

<p>"'Certainly not,' replied the little doctor. 'That's not the person
who insulted me last night.'</p>

<p>"'Very extraordinary!' exclaimed the officer.</p>

<p>"'Very,' said the gentleman with the camp-stool."</p></div>

<p>Mutual explanations follow, and, notwithstanding the
temporary dissatisfaction of Dr. Payne, Mr. Winkle comes out
like a trump&mdash;defends the honour of the Pickwick Club and
its uniform, and wins the admiration of Dr. Slammer.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'My dear sir,' said the good-humoured little doctor, advancing
with extended hand, 'I honour your gallantry. Permit me to say,
Sir, that I highly admire your conduct, and extremely regret having
caused you the inconvenience of this meeting, to no purpose.'</p>

<p>"'I beg you won't mention it, Sir,' said Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>"'I shall feel proud of your acquaintance, Sir,' said the little
doctor.</p>

<p>"'It will afford me the greatest pleasure to know you, Sir,' replied
Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>"Thereupon the doctor and Mr. Winkle shook hands, and then
Mr. Winkle and Lieutenant Tappleton (the doctor's second), and then
Mr. Winkle and the man with the camp-stool, and finally Mr.
Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass: the last-named gentleman in an excess
of admiration at the noble conduct of his heroic friend.</p>

<p>"'I think we may adjourn,' said Lieutenant Tappleton.</p>

<p>"'Certainly,' added the doctor."</p></div>

<p>We ourselves also adjourn, taking with us many pleasant
memories of Chatham and Fort Pitt, and of the period relating
to "the childhood and youth of Charles Dickens."</p>

<span class="caption">Birthplace of Charles Dickens,<br />
387 Mile End Terrace, Commercial Road, Landport.</span>
</div>
<p>No tramp in "Dickens-Land" can possibly be complete
without a visit to the birthplace of the great novelist, and on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
another occasion we therefore devote a day to Portsea, Hants.
A fast train from Victoria by the London, Brighton, and South
Coast Railway takes us to Portsmouth Town, the nearest
station, which is about half a mile from Commercial Road,
and a tram-car puts us down at the door. We immediately
recognize the house from the picture in Mr. Langton's book,
but the first impression is that the illustration scarcely does
justice to it. From the picture it appears to us to be a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
ordinary house in a row, and to be situated rather low in
a crowded and not over respectable neighbourhood. Nothing
of the kind. The house, No. 387, Mile End Terrace, Commercial
Road, Landport, where the parents of Charles Dickens
resided before they removed to another part of Portsea, and
subsequently went to live at Chatham, and where the future
genius first saw light, was eighty years ago quite in a rural
neighbourhood; and in those days must have been considered
rather a genteel residence for a family of moderate means in
the middle class. Even now, with the pressure which always
attends the development of large towns, and their extension
on the border-land of green country by the frequent conversion
of dwelling-houses into shops, or the intrusion of shops
where dwelling-houses are, this residence has escaped and
remains unchanged to this day.</p>

<p>There is another point of real importance to notice. Mr.
Langton, referring to this house, says:&mdash;"The engraving
shows the little fore-court or front garden, with the low
kitchen window of the house, whence the movements of
Charles [who is presumably represented in the engraving by
the figure of a boy about two or three years old, with curly
locks, dressed in a smart frock, and having a large ball in his
right hand], attended by his dear little sister Fanny, could be
overlooked."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Very pretty indeed, but alas! I am afraid,
purely imaginary, considering, as will hereafter appear, that
Charles was a baby in arms, aged about four months and
sixteen days, when his parents quitted the house in which
he was born.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>
<p>The house is now, and has been for many years, occupied
by Miss Sarah Pearce, the surviving daughter of Mr. John
Dickens's landlord, her sisters, who formerly lived with her,
being all dead. It stands high on the west side of a good
broad road, opposite an old-fashioned villa called Angus
House, in the midst of well-trimmed grounds, and the situation
is very open, pleasant, and cheerful. It is red-brick built,
has a railing in front, and is approached by a little entrance-gate
opening on to a lawn, whereon there are a few flower-beds;
a hedge divides the fore-court from the next house,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
and a few steps guarded by a handrail lead to the front door.
It is a single-fronted, eight-roomed house, having two underground
kitchens, two floors above, and a single dormer
window high up in the sloping red-tiled roof. As is usual
with old-fashioned houses of this type, the shutters to the
lower windows are outside. Both the front and back parlours
on the ground floor are very cheerful, cosy little rooms (in
one of them we are glad to see a portrait of the novelist),
and the view from the back parlour looking down into the
well-kept garden, which abuts on other gardens, is very pretty,
marred only by a large gasometer in the distance, which
could hardly have been erected in young Charles Dickens's
earliest days. In the garden we notice a lovely specimen of
the <i>Lavatera arborea</i>, or tree-mallow, covered with hundreds
of white and purple blossoms. It is a rarity to see such a
handsome, well-grown tree, standing nearly eight feet high,
and it is not unlikely, from the luxuriance of its growth, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
it existed in Charles Dickens's infancy. From the pleasant
surroundings of the place generally, and from the fact that
flowers are much grown in the neighbourhood (especially
roses), it is more than probable that Dickens's love for flowers
was early developed by these associations. The road leads
to Cosham, and to the picturesque old ruin of Porchester
Castle, a nice walk from the town of Portsmouth, and
probably often traversed by Dickens, his sister, and his
nurse.</p>

<p>Mr. Langton states that "it is said in after years Charles
Dickens could remember places and things at Portsmouth
that he had not seen since he was an infant of little more
than two years old (he left Portsmouth when he was only
four or five), and there is no doubt whatever that many of
the earliest reminiscences of <i>David Copperfield</i> were also
tender childish memories of his own infancy at this place."</p>

<p>Mr. William Pearce, solicitor of Portsea, son of the former
landlord, and brother of Miss Sarah Pearce, the present
occupant, has been kind enough to supply the following
interesting information respecting No. 387, Mile End
Terrace:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The celebrated novelist was born in the front bedroom
of the above house, which my sisters many years ago converted
into a drawing-room, and it is still used as such.</p>

<p>"Mr. John Dickens, the father of the novelist, and his wife
came to reside in the house directly after they were married.
Mr. John Dickens rented the house of my father at &pound;35
a-year, from the 24th June, 1808, until the 24th June, 1812,
when he quitted, and moved into Hawke Street, in the town
of Portsea. Miss Fanny Dickens, the novelist's sister, was
the first child born in the house, and then the novelist.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was born on the 22nd February, 1814, and have often
heard my mother say that Mr. Gardner, the surgeon, and
Mrs. Purkis, the monthly nurse (both of whom attended my
mother with me and her six other children), attended Mrs.
Dickens with her two children, Fanny and Charles, who were
both born in the above house; besides this, Mrs. Purkis has
often called on my sisters at the house in question, and
alluded to the above circumstances.</p>

<span class="caption">St. Mary&#39;s Church, Portsea.</span>
</div>

<p>"Mr. Cobb (whom I recollect), a fellow-clerk of Mr. John
Dickens in the pay-office in the Portsmouth Dockyard,
rented the same house of my father after Mr. John Dickens
left, and often alluded to the many happy hours he spent in
it while Mr. Dickens resided there."</p>

<p>We next visit the site of old Kingston Parish Church,&mdash;St.
Mary's, Portsea&mdash;where Charles Dickens was baptized on 4th
March, 1812. A very handsome and large new church, costing
nearly forty thousand pounds, and capable of seating over two
thousand persons, has been erected, and occupies the place of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the old church, where the ceremony took place. Mr. Langton
has given a very pretty little drawing of the old church in
his book, so that its associations are preserved to lovers of
Dickens. The old church itself was the second edifice erected
on the same spot, and thus the present one is the third
parish church which has been built here. There is a large
and crowded burial-ground attached to it; but a cursory
examination does not disclose any names on the gravestones
to indicate characters in the novels.</p>

<p>It is right to note here, that the kind people of Portsmouth
were desirous of inserting a stained-glass window in their
beautiful new church to the memory of one of their most
famous sons (the eminent novelist, Mr. Walter Besant, was
born at Portsmouth, as also were Isambard K. Brunel, the
engineer, and Messrs. George and Vicat Cole, Royal Academicians),
but they were debarred by the conditions of Dickens's
will, which expressly interdicted anything of the kind. It
states:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I conjure my friends on no account to make me the
subject of any monument, memorial, or testimonial whatever.
I rest my claim to the remembrance of my country upon
my published works, and to the remembrance of my friends
upon their experience of me in addition thereto."</p>

<p>Before leaving Portsmouth, we just take a hasty glance at
the Theatre Royal, which remains much as it was during the
days of Mr. Vincent Crummles and his company, as graphically
described in the twenty-second and following chapters of
<i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>. Of that genial manager, Mr. T. Edgar
Pemberton, in his <i>Charles Dickens and the Stage</i>, observes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Every line that is written about Mr. Crummles and his
followers is instinct with good-natured humour, and from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
moment when, in the road-side inn 'yet twelve miles short
of Portsmouth,' the reader comes into contact with the kindly
old circuit manager, he finds himself in the best of good
company."</p>

<p>Mr. Rimmer, in his <i>About England with Dickens</i>, referring
to the "Common Hard" at Portsmouth, says that the
"people there point out in a narrow lane leading to the
wharf, the house where Nicholas is supposed to have
sojourned."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>AYLESFORD, TOWN MALLING, AND MAIDSTONE.</h3>

<div class="hang2">"Its river winding down from the mist on the horizon, as though that
were its source, and already heaving with a restless knowledge of its
approach towards the sea."&mdash;<i>Edwin Drood.</i></div>

<div class="hang2">"Oh, the solemn woods over which the light and shadow travelled swiftly,
as if Heavenly wings were sweeping on benignant errands through the
summer air; the smooth green slopes, the glittering water, the garden
where the flowers were symmetrically arranged in clusters of the richest
colours, how beautiful they looked!"&mdash;<i>Bleak House.</i></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Another</span> delightful morning, fine but overcast, favours our
tramp in this neighbourhood. We are up betimes on Monday,
and take the train by the South-Eastern Railway from Strood
station to Aylesford. It is a distance of nearly eight miles
between these places; and the intermediate stations of any
note which we pass on the way are Cuxton (about three miles)
and Snodland (about two miles further on), which are two
large villages. As the railway winds, we obtain excellent
views of the chalk escarpments on the series of hills opposite,
these being the result of centuries of quarrying. The land
on either side of the river is marshy and intersected by
numerous water-courses. These grounds are locally termed
"saltings," caused by the overflow of the Medway at certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
times, and are used as sanitaria for horses which require
bracing.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_312.png" width="500" height="507" alt="Aylesford" title="" />
</div>

<p>Cuxton is at the entrance of the valley between the two
chalk ranges of hills which form the water-parting of the
river Medway. As Mr Phillips Bevan rightly observes&mdash;"this
valley is utilized for quarrying and lime-burning to
such an extent, that it has almost the appearance of a
northern manufacturing district," but it is a consolation, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the authority of Sir A. C. Ramsay, to know that "man cannot
permanently disfigure nature!"</p>

<p>At Snodland the river becomes narrower, and the scenery
of the valley is more picturesque. Early British and Roman
remains have been found in the district, and according to
the authority previously quoted&mdash;"In one of the quarries,
which are abundant, Dr. Mantell discovered some of the
most interesting and rarest chalk fossils with which we are
acquainted, including the fossil Turtle (<i>Chelonia Benstedi</i>)."</p>

<p>Alighting from the train at Aylesford station, we have but
a few minutes to ramble by the river, the banks of which
are brightened by the handsome flowers of the purple loosestrife.
We notice the charming position of the Norman
church, which stands on an eminence on the right bank of
the Medway, overlooking the main street, and is surrounded
by fine old elm trees&mdash;the bells were chiming "Home, sweet
home," a name very dear to Dickens. The Medway ceases
to be a tidal river at Allington beyond Aylesford, and one
or other of the weirs at Allington or Farleigh (further on)
may have suggested the idea of "Cloisterham Weir" in
<i>Edwin Drood;</i> but they are too far distant (as shown in
Chapter V.) to fit in with the story. The ancient stone bridge
which spans the Medway at Aylesford is seven-arched; a
large central one, and three smaller ones on either side. One
or two of the arches on the left bank are filled up, as though
the river had silted on that side. Mr. Roach Smith considers
the bridge to be a very fine specimen of medi&aelig;val architecture.
It is somewhat narrow, but there are large abutments
which afford shelter to foot passengers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>
<img src="images/i_314.png" width="600" height="443" alt="Aylesford Bridge" title="" />
</div>

<p>We are much inclined to think that Aylesford Bridge was
in the mind of Dickens when he makes the Pickwickians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
cross the Medway, only a wooden bridge is mentioned in
the text for the purpose perhaps of concealing identity. The
place is certainly worth visiting, and the approach to it by
the river is exceedingly picturesque.</p>

<p>Aylesford is supposed to be the place where the great
battle between Hengist and Vortigern took place. Near to
it, at a place called Horsted, is the tomb of Horsa, who fell
in the battle between the Britons and Saxons, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 455.
Names of Dickens's characters, Brooks, Joy, etc., occur at
Aylesford. There is a very fine quarry here, from whence
the famous Kentish rag-stone&mdash;"a concretionary limestone"&mdash;is
obtained. It forms the base, and is overlaid by the
Hassock sands and the river drift. In the distance is seen the
bold series of chalk rocks constituting the ridge of the valley.</p>

<p>Just outside Aylesford we pass Preston Hall, a fine modern
Tudor mansion standing in very pretty grounds, and belonging
to Mr. H. Brassey.</p>

<p>We now resume our tramp towards the principal point of
our destination, Town Malling,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> or West Malling, as it is
indifferently called (the "a" in Malling being pronounced
long, as in "calling"). The walk from Aylesford lies through
the village of Larkview, and is rather pretty, but there is
nothing remarkable to notice until we approach Town
Malling. Here it becomes beautifully wooded, especially in
the neighbourhood of Clare House Park, the Spanish or
edible chestnut, with its handsome dark green lanceolate
serrate leaves, and clumps of Scotch firs, with their light red
trunks and large cones, the result of healthy growth, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
would have delighted the heart of Mr. Ruskin, being conspicuous.
On the road we pass a field sown with maize, a
novelty to one accustomed to the Midlands. The farmer to
whom it belongs says that it is a poor crop this year,
owing to the excess of wet and late summer, but in a good
season it gives a fine yield. We are informed that it is used
in the green state as food for cattle and chickens.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_316.png" width="450" height="359" alt="The High St Town Malling" title="" />
</div>

<p>A pleasant tramp of about three miles brings us to Town
Malling, which stands on the Kentish rag. The approach
to Town Malling is by a waterfall, and there are the ruins of
the old Nunnery, founded by Bishop Gundulph in 1090, in
the place. East Malling is a smaller town, and lies nearer
to Maidstone. Our object in visiting this pretty, old-fashioned
Kentish country town, is to verify its identity with that of
Muggleton of the <i>Pickwick Papers</i>. Great weight must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
attached to the fact that the present Mr. Charles Dickens, in
his annotated Jubilee Edition of the above work, introduces
a very pretty woodcut of "High Street, Town Malling," with
a note to the effect that&mdash;</p>

<p>"Muggleton, perhaps, is only to be taken as a fancy sketch
of a small country town; but it is generally supposed, and
probably with sufficient accuracy, that, if it is in any degree
a portrait of any Kentish town, Town Malling, a great place
for cricket in Mr. Pickwick's time, sat for it."</p>

<p>The reader will remember that when at the hospitable
Mr. Wardle's residence at Manor Farm in Dingley Dell
(by the bye, there is a veritable "Manor Farm" at Frindsbury,
near Strood, with ponds adjacent, which may perhaps have
suggested the episode of Mr. Pickwick on the ice), an excursion
was determined on by the Pickwickians to witness a
grand cricket match about to be played between the "All
Muggleton" and the "Dingley Dellers," a conference first
took place as to whether the invalid, Mr. Tupman, should
remain or go with them.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'Shall we be justified,' asked Mr. Pickwick, 'in leaving our
wounded friend to the care of the ladies?'</p>

<p>"'You cannot leave me in better hands,' said Mr. Tupman.</p>

<p>"'Quite impossible,' said Mr. Snodgrass."</p></div>

<p>The result of the conference was satisfactory.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was therefore settled that Mr. Tupman should be left at home
in charge of the females, and that the remainder of the guests under
the guidance of Mr. Wardle should proceed to the spot, where was
to be held that trial of skill, which had roused all Muggleton from
its torpor, and inoculated Dingley Dell with a fever of excitement.</p>

<p>"As their walk, <i>which was not above two miles long</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> lay through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
shady lanes and sequestered footpaths, and as their conversation
turned upon the delightful scenery by which they were on every side
surrounded, Mr. Pickwick was almost inclined to regret the expedition
they had used, when he found himself in the main street of the
town of Muggleton."</p></div>

<p>The chronicle of <i>Pickwick</i> then proceeds to state that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Muggleton is a corporate town, with a mayor, burgesses, and
freemen; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an ancient and loyal borough, mingling a zealous
advocacy of Christian principles with a devoted attachment to commercial
rights; in demonstration whereof, the mayor, corporation,
and other inhabitants, have presented at divers times, no fewer than
one thousand four hundred and twenty petitions, against the continuance
of negro slavery abroad, and an equal number against any
interference with the factory system at home; sixty-eight in favour of
the sales of livings in the Church, and eighty-six for abolishing
Sunday trading in the streets."</p></div>

<p>On the occasion of their second visit to Manor Farm to
spend Christmas, the Pickwickians came by the "Muggleton
Telegraph," which stopped at the "Blue Lion," and they
walked over to Dingley Dell.</p>

<p>Assuming, as has been suggested by Mr. Frost in his <i>In
Kent with Charles Dickens</i>, that Dingley Dell is somewhere on
the eastern side of the river Medway, within fifteen miles of
Rochester,&mdash;Mr. William James Budden (a gentleman whom
we met at Chatham) gave as his opinion that it was near
Burham,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>&mdash;then it would require a much greater walk than that
("which was not above two miles long") to reach Town
Malling (leaving out of the question the fact that Burham is
only about six miles from Rochester instead of fifteen miles,
as the waiter at the Bull told Mr. Pickwick in reply to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
enquiry), whereby we reluctantly for the time arrive at the
conclusion,&mdash;as Mr. Frost did before us&mdash;that Dingley Dell as
such near Town Malling cannot be identified.</p>

<p>On another visit to "Dickens-Land" Mr. R. L. Cobb
suggested that Cobtree Hall, near Aylesford, was the prototype
of Dingley Dell. It may have been; but except one
goes as the crow flies, it is more than two miles distant
from Town Malling. But as Captain Cuttle would say&mdash;we
"make a note of it."</p>

<p>After all, Dingley Dell is no doubt a type of an English
yeoman's hospitable home. There are numbers of such in
Kent, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Devonshire, and other
counties, and the one in question may have been seen by
Dickens almost anywhere.</p>

<p>There is, at any rate, one objection to Muggleton being
Town Malling&mdash;the latter is not, as mentioned in the text, "a
corporate town." The neighbouring corporate towns which
might be taken for it are Faversham, Tunbridge Wells, and
Seven Oaks; but, as Mr. Rimmer, in his <i>About England with
Dickens</i>, points out&mdash;"These have no feature in common
with the enterprising borough which had so distinguished
itself in the matter of petitions." On the other hand, there is
<i>one</i> very strong reason in favour of Town Malling, and that is
its devotion to the noble old English game of cricket. So far
as we could make out, no town in Kent has done better
service in this respect. But more of this presently.</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>


<p>So many friends recommended us to see Cobtree Hall
that, after the foregoing was written, we determined to follow
their advice, and on a subsequent occasion we take the train
to Aylesford and walk over, the distance being a pleasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
stroll of about a mile. We were well repaid. The mansion,
formerly called Coptray Friars, belonging to the Aylesford
Friary, is an Elizabethan structure of red brick with stone
facings prettily covered with creeping plants, standing
on an elevated position in a beautifully wooded and undulating
country overlooking the Medway
and surrounded by cherry
orchards and hop gardens. Major
Trousdell was so courteous as to
show us over the building, which
has been altered and much enlarged during the last half
century. Internally there is something to favour the hypothesis
of its being the type of Manor Farm, Dingley Dell.
Such portions of the old building remaining, as the kitchen,
are highly suggestive of the gathering described in that good-humoured
Christmas chapter of <i>Pickwick</i> (xxviii.), and there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
is a veritable beam to correspond with Phiz's plate of "Christmas
Eve at Mr. Wardle's." "The best sitting-room, [described
as] a good long, dark-panelled room with a high chimney-piece,
and a capacious chimney up which you could have
driven one of the new patent cabs, wheels and all," may still
be discerned in the handsome modern dining-room, with
carved marble mantel-piece of massive size formerly supplied
with old-fashioned "dogs." The views from the bay-window
are very extensive and picturesque. The mansion divides the
two parishes of Boxley and Allington, the initials of which
are carved on the beam in the kitchen. Externally, there is
much more to commend it to our acceptance. Remains of a
triangular piece of ground, with a few elm-trees, still survive
as "the rookery," where Mr. Tupman met with his mishap,
and to our delight there is "the pond," not indeed covered
with ice, as on Mr. Pickwick's memorable adventure, but
crowded with water-lilies on its surface; its banks surrounded
by the fragrant meadow-sweet and the brilliant rose-coloured
willow herb. Furthermore we were informed, by Mr. Franklin
of Maidstone, that the "Red Lion," which formerly stood on
the spot now occupied by Mercer's Stables, is locally considered
to be the original of "a little roadside public-house,
with two elm-trees, a horse-trough, and a sign-post in front;"
where the Pickwickians sought assistance after the breakdown
of the "four-wheeled chaise" which "separated the
wheels from the body and the bin from the perch," but were
inhospitably repulsed by the "red-headed man and the tall
bony woman," who suggested that they had stolen the
"immense horse" which had recently played Mr. Winkle
such pranks. Finally, in a pleasant chat with the Rev. Cyril
Grant, Vicar of Aylesford, and his curate, the Rev. H. B. Boyd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
(a son of A. K. H. B.), we elicited the fact that Cobtree Hall
is locally recognized as the original of Manor Farm. Nay
more, in Aylesford churchyard a tomb was pointed out on the
west side with the inscription:&mdash;"Also to the memory of Mr.
W. Spong, late of Cobtree, in the Parish of Boxley, who died
Nov. 15th, 1839," who is said to have been the prototype of
the genial and hospitable "old Wardle."</p>

<div class='blockquot3'><p>True, neither the distance to Rochester nor to Town
Malling fits in with the narrative, but this is not material.
Dickens, with the usual "novelist's licence," found it convenient
often-times to take a nucleus of fact, and surround
it with a halo of fiction, and this may have been one of
many similar instances. His wonderfully-gifted and ever-facile
imagination was never at fault.</p></div>

<p>So on our return journey we console ourselves by reading
the following description, in chapter vi. of <i>Pickwick</i>, of
the first gathering of the Pickwickians at their host's, one
of the most delightful bits in the whole book, and "make-believe,"
as the Marchioness would say, that we have actually
seen Manor Farm, Dingley Dell.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Several guests who were assembled in the old parlour, rose to
greet Mr. Pickwick and his friends upon their entrance; and during
the performance of the ceremony of introduction, with all due
formalities, Mr. Pickwick had leisure to observe the appearance, and
speculate upon the characters and pursuits, of the persons by whom
he was surrounded&mdash;a habit in which he in common with many
other great men delighted to indulge.</p>

<p>"A very old lady, in a lofty cap and faded silk gown,&mdash;no less a
personage than Mr. Wardle's mother,&mdash;occupied the post of honour
on the right-hand corner of the chimney-piece; and various certificates
of her having been brought up in the way she should go when
young, and of her not having departed from it when old, ornamented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the walls, in the form of samplers of ancient date, worsted landscapes
of equal antiquity, and crimson silk tea-kettle holders of a more
modern period. The aunt, the two young ladies, and Mr. Wardle,
each vying with the other in paying zealous and unremitting attentions
to the old lady, crowded round her easy-chair, one holding her
ear-trumpet, another an orange, and a third a smelling-bottle, while
a fourth was busily engaged in patting and punching the pillows,
which were arranged for her support. On the opposite side sat a
bald-headed old gentleman, with a good-humoured benevolent face,&mdash;the
clergyman of Dingley Dell; and next him sat his wife, a stout,
blooming old lady, who looked as if she were well skilled, not only
in the art and mystery of manufacturing home-made cordials, greatly
to other people's satisfaction, but of tasting them occasionally, very
much to her own. A little hard-headed, Ripstone pippin-faced man,
was conversing with a fat old gentleman in one corner; and two or
three more old gentlemen, and two or three more old ladies, sat bolt
upright and motionless on their chairs, staring very hard at Mr.
Pickwick and his fellow-voyagers.</p>

<p>"'Mr. Pickwick, mother,' said Mr. Wardle, at the very top of his
voice.</p>

<p>"'Ah!' said the old lady, shaking her head; 'I can't hear
you.'</p>

<p>"'Mr. Pickwick, grandma!' screamed both the young ladies
together.</p>

<p>"'Ah!' exclaimed the old lady. 'Well; it don't much matter.
He don't care for an old 'ooman like me, I dare say.'</p>

<p>"'I assure you, madam,' said Mr. Pickwick, grasping the old
lady's hand, and speaking so loud that the exertion imparted a
crimson hue to his benevolent countenance; 'I assure you, ma'am,
that nothing delights me more, than to see a lady of your time of
life heading so fine a family, and looking so young and well.'</p>

<p>"'Ah!' said the old lady, after a short pause; 'it's all very fine,
I dare say; but I can't hear him.'</p>

<p>"'Grandma's rather put out now,' said Miss Isabella Wardle, in
a low tone; 'but she'll talk to you presently.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Pickwick nodded his readiness to humour the infirmities of
age, and entered into a general conversation with the other members
of the circle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Delightful situation this,' said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>"'Delightful!' echoed Messrs. Snodgrass, Tupman, and Winkle.</p>

<p>"'Well, I think it is,' said Mr. Wardle.</p>

<p>"'There ain't a better spot o' ground in all Kent, sir,' said the
hard-headed man with the pippin-face; 'there ain't indeed, sir&mdash;I'm
sure there ain't, sir,' and the hard-headed man looked triumphantly
round, as if he had been very much contradicted by somebody,
but had got the better of him at last. 'There ain't a better
spot o' ground in all Kent,' said the hard-headed man again after a
pause.</p>

<p>"''Cept Mullins' meadows!' observed the fat man, solemnly.</p>

<p>"'Mullins' meadows!' ejaculated the other, with profound
contempt.</p>

<p>"'Ah, Mullins' meadows,' repeated the fat man.</p>

<p>"'Reg'lar good land that,' interposed another fat man.</p>

<p>"'And so it is, sure-ly,' said a third fat man.</p>

<p>"'Everybody knows that,' said the corpulent host.</p>

<p>"The hard-headed man looked dubiously round, but finding
himself in a minority, assumed a compassionate air, and said no
more.</p>

<p>"'What are they talking about?' inquired the old lady of one of
her grand-daughters, in a very audible voice; for, like many deaf
people, she never seemed to calculate on the possibility of other
persons hearing what she said herself.</p>

<p>"'About the land, grandma.'</p>

<p>"'What about the land? Nothing the matter, is there?'</p>

<p>"'No, no. Mr. Miller was saying our land was better than
Mullins' meadows.'</p>

<p>"'How should he know anything about it?' inquired the old lady
indignantly. 'Miller's a conceited coxcomb, and you may tell him
I said so.' Saying which, the old lady, quite unconscious that she
had spoken above a whisper, drew herself up, and looked carving-knives
at the hard-headed delinquent."</p></div>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>In the course of our tramp we fall in with "a very queer
small boy," rejoicing in the Christian names of "Spencer
Ray," upon which we congratulate him, and express a hope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
that he will do honour to the noble names which he bears,
one being that of the great English philosopher, and the
other that of the famous English naturalist. This boy, who
is just such a bright intelligent lad as Dickens himself would
have been at his age (twelve and a half years), gives us some
interesting particulars respecting Town Malling and its
proclivities for cricket, upon which he is very eloquent. It
appears that in the year 1887 the cricketers of Town Malling
won eleven matches out of twelve; but during this year they
have not been so successful. He directed us to the cricket-ground,
which we visit, and find to be but a few minutes'
walk from the centre of the town, bearing to the westward.
It is a very fine field, nearly seven acres in extent, in splendid
order, as level as a die, and as green as an emerald. It lies
well open, and is flanked by the western range of hills of the
Medway valley.</p>

</div>

<p>The marquee into which Mr. Pickwick and his friends were
invited, first by "one very stout gentleman, whose body and
legs looked like half a gigantic roll of flannel, elevated on a
couple of inflated pillow-cases," and then by the irrepressible
Jingle with&mdash;"This way&mdash;this way&mdash;capital fun&mdash;lots of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
beer&mdash;hogsheads; rounds of beef&mdash;bullocks; mustard&mdash;cart-loads;
glorious day&mdash;down with you&mdash;make yourself at
home&mdash;glad to see you&mdash;very," has been replaced by a
handsome pavilion.</p>

<p>There is no cricket-playing going on at the time, but
there are several cricketers in the field, and from them we
learn confirmatory evidence of the long existence of the
ground in its present condition, and the enthusiasm of the
inhabitants for the old English game.</p>

<p>Another proof of the long-established love of the people of
Town Malling for cricket we subsequently find in the fact
that the parlour of the Swan Hotel, which is an old cricketing
house, and probably represents the "Blue Lion of Muggleton,"
has in it many very fine lithographic portraits of all the great
cricketers of the middle of the nineteenth century, including:&mdash;Pilch,
Lillywhite, Box, Cobbett, Hillyer (a native of Town
Malling), A. Mynn, Taylor, Langdon, Kynaston, Felix
(<i>Felix on the Bat</i>), Ward, Kingscote, and others. Several
of these names will be recognized as those of eminent Kentish
cricketers. About a quarter of a century ago&mdash;my friend
and colleague Mr. E. Orford Smith (himself a Kentish man
and a cricketer) informs me that&mdash;the Kentish eleven stood
against all England, and retained their position for some
years.</p>

<p>As we stand on the warm day in the centre of the ground,
and admire the lights and shadows passing over the surrounding
scenery, we can almost conjure up the scene of the
famous contest, when, on the occasion of the first innings of
the All-Muggleton Club, "Mr. Dumkins and Mr. Podder, two
of the most renowned members of that most distinguished
club, walked, bat in hand, to their respective wickets. Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Luffey, the highest ornament of Dingley Dell, was pitched to
bowl against the redoubtable Dumkins, and Mr. Struggles
was selected to do the same kind office for the hitherto
unconquered Podder."</p>

<p>Everybody remembers how the game proceeded under
circumstances of the greatest excitement, in which batters,
bowlers, scouts, and umpires, all did their best under the
encouraging shouts of the members:&mdash;"Run&mdash;run&mdash;another.&mdash;Now,
then, throw her up&mdash;up with her&mdash;stop there&mdash;another&mdash;no&mdash;yes&mdash;no&mdash;throw
her up! throw her up!" Mr. Jingle
himself being as usual very profuse in his remarks, as&mdash;"'Ah,
ah!&mdash;stupid'&mdash;'Now, butter-fingers'&mdash;'Muff'&mdash;'Humbug'&mdash;and
so forth." "In short, when Dumkins was caught out,
and Podder stumped out, All-Muggleton had notched some
fifty-four, while the score of the Dingley Dellers was as blank
as their faces." So "Dingley Dell gave in, and allowed the
superior prowess of All-Muggleton," Mr. Jingle again expressing
his views of the winners:&mdash;"'Capital game&mdash;well played&mdash;some
strokes admirable,' as both sides crowded into the
tent at the conclusion of the game."</p>

<p>Yes! We are convinced that Muggleton and Town Malling
(except for the mayor and corporation) are one. At any
rate we feel quite safe in assuming that Town Malling was
the type from which Muggleton was taken; and we confidently
recommend all admirers of <i>Pickwick</i> to include that
pleasant Kentish country-town in their pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Having exhausted, so far as our examination is concerned,
the cricket-ground, by the kindness of our young friend who
acts as guide, we see a little more of the town. It consists
of a long wide street, with a few lateral approaches. The
houses are well built, and the church, which is partly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Norman, and, like most of the village churches in Kent,
is but a little way from the village, stands on an eminence
from whence a good view may be obtained. We observe, as
indicative of the fine air and mild climate of the place, many
beautiful specimens of magnolia, and wistaria (in second
flower) in front of the better class of houses. One of these is
named "Boley House," and as we are told that Sir Joseph
Hawley resided near, our memories immediately revert to the
cognomen of a well-known character in <i>The Chimes</i>. Other
names in the place are suggestive of Dickens's worthies, <i>e.g.</i>
Rudge, Styles, Briggs, Saunders, Brooker, and John Harman.
The last-mentioned is the second instance in which Dickens
has varied a local name by the alteration of a single letter.
There is also the not uncommon name of "Brown," who, it
will be remembered, was the maker of the shoes of the
spinster aunt when she eloped with the faithless Jingle; "in
a po-chay from the 'Blue Lion' at Muggleton," as one of Mr.
Wardle's men said; and the discovery of the said shoes led to
the identification of the errant pair at the "White Hart" in
the Borough. After Sam Weller had described nearly all the
visitors staying in the hotel from an examination of their
boots:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'Stop a bit,' replied Sam, suddenly recollecting himself. 'Yes;
there's a pair of Vellingtons a good deal vorn, and a pair o' lady's
shoes, in number five.' 'Country make.'</p>

<p>"'Any maker's name?'</p>

<p>"'Brown.'</p>

<p>"'Where of?'</p>

<p>"'Muggleton.'</p>

<p>"'It <i>is</i> them,' exclaimed Wardle. 'By heavens, we've found
them.'"</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>What happened afterwards every reader of <i>Pickwick</i> very
well knows.</p>

<p>Near Town Malling there is a curious monument erected
to the memory of Beadsman, the horse, belonging to Sir
Joseph Hawley, which won the Derby in 1859, and which
was bred in the place. The monument (an exceedingly
practical one) consists of a useful pump for the supply of
water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="medway" id="medway"></a>
<img src="images/i_330.png" width="500" height="544" alt="The Medway at Maidstone" title="" />
</div>

<p>After some luncheon at the Boar Inn, we are sorry to
terminate our visit to this pleasant place; but time flies, and
trains, like tides, "wait for no man." So we hurry to the
railway station, passing on our way a fine hop-garden, and
take tickets by the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway for
Maidstone. We have a few minutes to spare, and our notice
is attracted to a curious group in the waiting-room. It
consists of a rural policeman, and what afterwards turned out,
to be his prisoner, a slouching but good-humoured-looking
labourer, with a "fur cap" like Rogue Riderhood. The officer
leans against the mantelpiece, pleasantly chatting with his
charge, who is seated on the bench, leisurely eating some
bread and cheese with a large clasp-knife, in the intervals
of which proceeding he recounts some experiences for the
edification of the officer and bystanders. These are occasionally
received with roars of laughter. One of his stories
relates to a house-breaker who, being "caught in the act" by
a policeman, and being asked what he was doing, coolly
replied, "Attending to my business, of course!" (This must
surely be taken "in a Pickwickian sense.") After finishing
his bread and cheese, the charge eats an apple, and then
regales himself with something from a large bottle. The
unconcernedness of the man, whatever his offence may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
(poaching perhaps), is in painful contrast to the careworn
and anxious faces of his wife and little daughter (both
decently dressed), the latter about seven years old, and
made too familiar with crime at such an age. After we
arrive at Maidstone (only a few minutes' run by railway),
it is a wretched sight to witness the leave-taking at the
gaol. First the man shakes hands with his wife, all his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
forced humour having left him, and then affectionately kisses
the little girl, draws a cuff over his eyes, and walks heavily
into the gaol after the officer. We are glad to notice that he
is not degraded as a wild beast by being handcuffed. It
was an episode that Dickens himself perhaps would have
witnessed with interest, and possibly stored up for future use.
What particularly strikes us is the difference in the relations
between these people and what would be the case under
similar circumstances in a large town. There is not that
feature of hardness, that familiarity with crime which breeds
contempt, in the rural incident. Poor man! let us hope
his punishment will soon be finished, and that he may
return to his family, and not become an old offender; but
for the present, as Mr. Bagnet says, "discipline must be
maintained."</p>

<p>Maidstone, the county and assize town of Kent, appears to
be a thriving and solid-looking place, as there are several
paper-mills, saw-mills, stone quarries, and other indications of
prosperity. There are but few historical associations connected
with it, as Maidstone "has lived a quiet life." Sir
Thomas Wyatt's rebellion, and the attack on the town by
Fairfax in 1648, are among the principal incidents. Dickens
frequently walked or drove over to this town from Gad's
Hill. Many of the names which we notice over the shops in
the principal street are very suggestive of, if not actually
used for, some of the characters in his novels, <i>e.g.</i> Pell,
Boozer, Hibling, Fowle, Stuffins, Bunyard, Edmed, Gregsbey,
Dunmill, and Pobgee.</p>

<p>It has been said that Maidstone possesses a gaol; it also
has large barracks, and, what is better still, a Museum, Free
Library, and Public Gardens. Chillington Manor House,&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
highly picturesque and well-preserved Elizabethan structure,
formerly the residence of the Cobhams,&mdash;contains the Museum
and Library. Standing in a quiet nook in the Brenchley
Gardens, the lines of George Macdonald, quoted in the local
<i>Guide Book</i>, well describe its beauties:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Its windows were a&euml;rial and latticed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Lovely and wide and fair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And its chimneys like clustered pillars</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Stood up in the thin blue air."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The Museum&mdash;the new wing of which was built as a
memorial of his brother, by Mr. Samuel Bentlif&mdash;is the property
of the Corporation, and owes much of its contents to the
liberality of Mr. Pretty, the first curator, and to the naturalist
and traveller, Mr. J. L. Brenchley. It contains excellent
fine art, arch&aelig;ological, ethnological, natural history, and
geological collections. Among the last-named, in addition
to other interesting local specimens, are some fossil remains
of the mammoth (<i>Elephas primigenius</i>) from the drift at
Aylesford, obtained by its present able curator, Mr. Edward
Bartlett, to whom we are indebted for a most pleasant
ramble through the various rooms. We notice an original
"Dickens-item" in the shape of a very good carved head of
the novelist, forming the right top panel of an oak fire-place,
the opposite side being one of Tennyson, by a local carver
named W. Hughes, who was formerly employed at Gad's Hill
Place. No pilgrim in "Dickens-Land" should omit visiting
Maidstone and its treasures in Chillington Manor House;
nor of seeing the splendid view of the Medway from the
churchyard, looking towards Tovil.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="manor" id="manor"></a>
<img src="images/i_333.png" width="500" height="419" alt="Chillingham Manor House Maidstone" title="" />
</div>

<p>We are particularly anxious to verify Dickens's experience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of the walk from Maidstone to Rochester. In a letter to
Forster, written soon after he came to reside at Gad's Hill
Place, he says:&mdash;"I have discovered that the seven miles
between Maidstone and Rochester is one of the most beautiful
walks in England," and so indeed we find it to be. It is,
however, a rather long seven miles; so, cheerfully leaving the
gloomy-looking gaol to our right and proceeding along the
raised terrace by the side of the turn-pike road, we pass
through the little village of Sandling, and soon after commence
the ascent of the great chalk range of hills which form
the eastern water-parting of the Medway. The most noticeable
object before we reach "Upper Bell" is "Kit's Coty (or Coity)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
House," about one and a half miles north-east from Aylesford,
and not very far from the Bell Inn. According to Mr. Phillips
Bevan, the peculiar name is derived from the Celtic "Ked," and
"Coity" or "Coed" (Welsh), and means the Tomb in the Wood.
Seymour considers the words a corruption of "Catigern's
House." Below Kit's Coty House, Mr. Wright, the arch&aelig;ologist,
found the remains of a Roman villa, with quantities
of Samian ware, coins, and other articles.</p>

<p>There are many excavations in the chalk above Kit's Coty
House, apparently for interments; and the whole district
appears in remote ages to have been a huge cemetery.
Tradition states that "the hero Catigern was buried here,
after the battle fought at Aylesford between Hengist and
Vortigern."</p>

<p>The Cromlech, which is now included in the provisions of
the Ancient Monuments Protection Act, 1882, lies under the
hillside, a few yards from the main road, and is fenced in
with iron railings, and beautifully surrounded by woods, the
yew,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> said to have been one of the sacred trees of the Druids,
being conspicuous here and there. That somewhat rare
plant the juniper is also found in this neighbourhood. The
"dolmens" which have been "set on end by a vanished
people" are four in number, and consist of sandstone, three
of them, measuring about eight feet each, forming the uprights,
and the fourth, which is much larger, serving as the covering
stone.</p>

<p>In a field which we visit, not very far from Kit's Coty
House, is another group of stones, called the "countless stones."
As we pass some boys are trying to solve the arithmetical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
problem, which cannot be readily accomplished, as the stones
lie intermingled in a very strange and irregular manner, and
are overgrown with brushwood. The belief that these stones
cannot be counted is one constantly found connected with
similar remains, <i>e.g.</i> Stonehenge, Avebury, etc. We heard a
local story of a baker, who once tried to effect the operation
by placing a loaf on the top of each stone as a kind of check
or tally; but a dog running away with one of his loaves,
upset his calculations.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_335.png" width="500" height="420" alt="Kit&#39;s Coty House" title="" />
</div>

<p>Both the "Coty House" and the "countless stones" consist
of a silicious sandstone of the Eocene period, overlying the
chalk, and are identical with the "Sarsens," or "Grey Wethers,"
which occur at the pre-historic town of Avebury, and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Stonehenge; the smaller stones of the latter are, however, of
igneous origin, and "are believed by Mr. Fergusson to have
been votive offerings." These masses, of what Sir A. C.
Ramsay calls "tough and intractable silicious stone," have
been, he says, "left on the ground, after the removal by denudation
of other and softer parts of the Eocene strata." We
subsequently saw several of these "grey wethers" in the
grounds of Cobham Hall, and we noticed small masses
of the same stone <i>in situ</i> in Pear Tree Lane, near Gad's
Hill Place.</p>

<p>Speaking of Kit's Coty House in his <i>Short History of the
English People</i>, the late Mr. J. R. Green, in describing the
English Conquest and referring to this neighbourhood,
says:&mdash;"It was from a steep knoll on which the grey
weather-beaten stones of this monument are reared that the
view of their first battle-field would break on the English
warriors; and a lane which still leads down from it through
peaceful homesteads would guide them across the ford which
has left its name in the little village of Aylesford. The
Chronicle of the conquering people tells nothing of the
rush that may have carried the ford, or of the fight that
went struggling up through the village. It only tells that
Horsa fell in the moment of victory, and the flint heap
of Horsted, which has long preserved his name, and was
held in after-time to mark his grave, is thus the earliest
of those monuments of English valour of which Westminster
is the last and noblest shrine. The victory of
Aylesford did more than give East Kent to the English;
it struck the keynote of the whole English conquest of
Britain."</p>

<p>Dickens's visits to this locality in his early days may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
have suggested the discovery of the stone with the inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_337.png" width="200" height="208" alt="Inscription" title="" />
</div>



<p>In later life he was fond of bringing his friends here "by a
couple of postilions in the old red jackets of the old red
royal Dover road" to enjoy a picnic. Describing a visit
here with Longfellow he says:&mdash;"It was like a holiday ride
in England fifty years ago."</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>
<img src="images/i_338.png" width="600" height="345" alt="Kits Coty House and &quot;Blue Bell&quot; From the Painting by Gegan" title="" />
</div>

<p>Returning to the main road, we reach the high land of Blue
Bell&mdash;"Upper Bell," as it is marked on the Ordnance Map.
We are not quite on the highest range, but sufficiently high
(about three hundred feet) to enable us to appreciate the
splendid view that presents itself. In the valley below winds
the Medway, broadening as it approaches Rochester.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The
opposite heights consist of the western range of hills, the
width of the valley from point to point being about ten miles.
The "sky-line" of hills running from north to south cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
be less than sixty miles, extending to the famous Weald of
Kent (weald, wald, or wolde, being literally "a wooded
region, an open country"); all the intervening space of
undulating slope and valley (river excepted) is filled up by
hamlets, grass, root, and cornfields, hop-gardens, orchards
and woodlands, the whole forming a picture of matchless
beauty. No wonder Dickens was very fond of this delightful
walk; it must be gone over to be appreciated.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>


<p>We tramp on through Boxley and Bridge Woods, down the
hill, and pass Borstal Convict Prison and Fort Clarence, where
there are guns which we were informed would carry a ball
from this elevated ground right over the Thames into the
county of Essex (a distance of seven miles); and so we get
back again to Rochester.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>BROADSTAIRS, MARGATE, AND CANTERBURY.</h3>

<div class="hang2">"We have a fine sea, wholesome for all people; profitable for the body,
profitable for the mind."&mdash;<i>Our English Watering-Place.</i></div>

<div class="hang2">"All is going on as it was wont. The waves are hoarse with repetition
of their mystery; the dust lies piled upon the shore; the sea-birds
soar and hover; the winds and clouds go forth upon their trackless
flight; the white arms beckon in the moonlight to the invisible country
far away."&mdash;<i>Dombey and Son.</i></div>

<div class="hang2">"A moment, and I occupy my place in the Cathedral, where we all went
together every Sunday morning, assembling first at school for that
purpose. The earthy smell, the sunless air, the sensation of the
world being shut out, the resounding of the organ through the black
and white arched galleries and aisles, are wings that take me back
and hold me hovering above those days in a half-sleeping and half-waking
dream."&mdash;<i>David Copperfield.</i></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Taking</span> advantage of an excursion train (for tramps usually
go on the cheap), we start early on Wednesday by the
South-Eastern Railway from Chatham station for Broadstairs.
As usual the weather favours us&mdash;it is a glorious
day. Passing the stations of New Brompton, Rainham,
Newington, and Sittingbourne, we soon get into open country,
in the midst of hop gardens with their verdant aisles of the
fragrant and tonic, tendril-like plants reaching in some
instances perhaps to several hundred yards, and crowned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
with yellowish-green fruit-masses, which have a special charm
for those unaccustomed to such scenery. The odd-looking
"oast-houses,"<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> or drying-houses for the hops, are a noticeable
feature of the neighbourhood, dotting it about here and there
in pairs. They are mostly red-brick and cone-shaped, somewhat
smaller than the familiar glass-houses of the Midland districts,
and have a wooden cowl, painted white, at the apex for
ventilation. We are rather too early for the hop-picking,
and thus&mdash;but for a time only&mdash;miss an interesting sight.
Dickens, in one of his letters to Forster, gives a dreary
picture of this annual harvest:&mdash;</div>

<p>"Hop-picking is going on, and people sleep in the garden,
and breathe in at the key-hole of the house door. I have
been amazed, before this year, by the number of miserable
lean wretches, hardly able to crawl, who come hop-picking.
I find it is a superstition that the dust of the newly-picked
hop, falling freshly into the throat, is a cure for consumption.
So the poor creatures drag themselves along the roads, and
sleep under wet hedges, and get cured soon and finally."</p>

<p>On the whole it is said to be a very indifferent season,
but many plantations look promising. "If," as a grower
remarks to us in the train, "we could have a little more of
this fine weather! There has been too much rain, and too
little sun this year." The apples also are a poor crop.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>
<img src="images/i_342.png" width="575" height="375" alt="Hop-picking in Kent" title="" />
</div>

<p>On a second visit to this pleasant neighbourhood, we see
at Mear's Barr Farm, near Rainham, the whole process of
hop-picking. True, it is not executed by that ragamuffinly
crowd of strangers which Dickens had in his "mind's eye"
when he wrote the words just quoted, and which usually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
takes possession of most of the hop-growing districts of Kent
during the picking season, but by an assemblage of native
villagers, mostly women, girls, and boys,&mdash;neat, clean, and
homely,&mdash;together with a few men who do the heavier part
of the work. They are of all ages, from the tottering old
grandmother, careworn wife, and buxom maiden, to the child
in perambulator and baby in arms; and in the bright sunlight,
amid the groves of festooning green columns, form
a most orderly, varied, and picturesque gathering&mdash;a regular
picnic in fact, judging from the cheerful look on most of the
faces, and the merry laugh that is occasionally heard.</p>

<p>Mr. Fred Scott, tenant of the farm, of which Lord Hothfield
is owner, is kind enough to go over the hop-garden with
us, and describe all the details. When the hops are ripe
(<i>i. e.</i> when the seeds are hard) and ready to be gathered, the
pickers swarm on the ground, and a man divides the "bine"
at the bottom of the "pole" by means of a bill-hook&mdash;not
cutting it too close for fear of bleeding&mdash;leaving the root to
sprout next year, and then draws out the pole, to which is
attached the long, creeping bine, trailing over at top. If the
pole sticks too fast in the ground, he eases it by means of a
lever, or "hop-dog" (a long, stout wooden implement, having
a toothed iron projection). "Mind my dog don't bite you,
sir," says one of the men facetiously, as we step over this
rough-looking tool. Women then carry the poles to, and
lay them across, the "bin," a receptacle formed by four
upright poles stuck in the ground and placed at an angle,
supporting a framework from which depends the "bin-cloth,"
made of jute or hemp, holding from ten to twenty bushels
of green hops, weighing about 1&frac12; lbs. per bushel when dry.</p>

<p>The picking then commences, and nimble fingers of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
sizes very soon strip the poles of the aromatically-smelling
ripe hops, the poles being cast aside in heaps, to be afterwards
cleared of the old bines and put into "stacks" of three
hundred each, and used again next season.</p>

<p>The bins, which vary in number according to the size of
the hop-garden, are placed in rows on the margin of the
plantation, and usually have ten "hop-hills" (<i>i. e.</i> plants) on
each side, and are moved inside the plantation as the poles
are pulled up. Each bin belongs to a "sett" (<i>i. e.</i> family or
companionship), consisting of from five to seven persons, and
is taken charge of by a "binman." When the bin is full, a
"measurer" (either the farmer himself or his deputy) takes
account of the quantity of hops picked, and records it in a
book to the credit of each working family. Then the green
hops are carted off in "pokes" or sacks to the "oast-houses"
to be dried. For this purpose, anthracite coal and charcoal
are used in the kiln, a shovelful or two of sulphur being added
to the fire when the hops are put on. The process of drying
takes eleven hours, and afterwards the dried hops are packed
in pockets which, when full, weigh about a hundredweight
and a half each, the packing being effected by hydraulic
pressure. They are then sent to market, the earliest arrivals
fetching very high prices. As much as &pound;50 per cwt. was
paid in 1882, but the ordinary price averages from &pound;4 to
&pound;8 per cwt.</p>

<p><i>Humulus Lupulus</i>, the hop, belongs to the natural order
<i>Urticace&aelig;</i>&mdash;a plant of rather wide distribution, but said to be
absent in Scotland&mdash;and is a herbaceous, di&oelig;cious perennial,
usually propagated by removal of the young shoots or by
cuttings. According to Sowerby, the genus is derived from
<i>humus</i>, the ground, as, unless supported or trained, the plant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
falls to the earth; and the common name "hop" from the
Saxon <i>hoppan</i>, to climb. William King, in his <i>Art of Cookery</i>,
says that "heresy and hops came in together"; while an old
popular rhyme records that:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Hops, carp, pickerel, and beer,<br />

<p>Tusser in his <i>Hondreth Good Points of Husbandrie</i>, published
in 1557, gives sundry directions for the cultivation of
hops, and quaintly advocates their use as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The hop for his profit I thus do exalt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It strengtheneth drink, and it savoureth malt;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And being well brewed, long kept it will last,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And drawing abide&mdash;if you draw not too fast."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The hop has many varieties&mdash;thirty or more&mdash;among which
may be mentioned prolifics, bramblings, goldings, common
goldings, old goldings, Canterbury goldings, Meopham goldings,
etc. When once planted they last for a hundred years,
but some growers replace them every ten years or sooner.</p>

<p>The principal enemies of the hop are "mould" caused by
the fungus <i>Sph&aelig;rotheca Castagnei</i>, and several kinds of insects,
especially the "green fly," <i>Aphis humuli</i>, but the high wind
is most to be dreaded. It tears the hop-bines from the poles
and throws the poles down, which in falling crush other bines,
and thus bruise the hops and prevent their growth, besides
obstructing the passage of air and sunlight, and causing the
development of mould or mildew. The remedy for mould
is dusting with sulphur, and for the green fly, syringing with
tobacco or quassia water and soap, "Hop-wash," as it is
called. Sometimes the lady-bird (<i>Coccinella septempunctata</i>)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
is present in sufficient numbers to consume the green fly.
Very little can be done to obviate the effects of the wind,
but a protective fence of the wild hop&mdash;called a "lee" or
"loo"&mdash;is sometimes put up round very choice plantations.</p>

<p>The hop-poles, the preparation of which constitutes a
distinct industry, are either of larch, Spanish chestnut, ash,
willow, birch, or beech&mdash;larch or chestnut being preferred.
Women clear the poles of the bark, and men sharpen them
at one end, which is dipped in creosote before being used.
The ground is cleared, and the poles are stuck in against the
old plants in February or March.</p>

<p>We are informed that the hop-picking is much looked
forward to by the villagers with pleasure as the means of
supplying them with a little purse for clothing, etc., against
winter-time. Each family or companionship earns from thirty
shillings to two pounds per week during the season.</p>

<p>We proceed on our excursion, and pass Faversham, which
stands in a rather picturesque bit of country some way up
Faversham Creek, and is sheltered on the west by a ridge
of wooded hills where the hop country ceases, as the railway
bends north-easterly for Margate and Ramsgate. Whitstable,
the next station passed, is famous for the most delicate
oysters in the market, the fishery of which is regulated by an
annual court; and it is said that one grower alone sends fifty
thousand barrels a year to London from this district. We
speculate whether these delicious molluscs were supplied at
that famous supper described in the thirty-ninth chapter of
<i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>, at which were present Kit, his
mother, the baby, little Jacob, and Barbara, after the night
at the play, when Kit told the waiter "to bring three dozen
of his largest-sized oysters, and to look sharp about it," and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
fulfilled his promise "to let little Jacob know what oysters
meant." All along, as the railway winds from Whitstable to
Margate, glimpses of the sea are visible, and vary our
excursion pleasantly.</p>

<p>The next noteworthy place we pass is Reculver&mdash;the
ancient Regulbium&mdash;which, according to Mr. Phillips Bevan,
is "mentioned in the Itinerary of Antoninus as being garrisoned
by the first cohort of Brabantois Belgians. After the Romans,
it was occupied by the Saxon Ethelbert, who is said to have
occupied it as a palace, and to have been buried there." "The
two picturesque towers" (quoting Bevan again), "which form
so conspicuous a land and sea mark, are called 'The Sisters,'
and are in reality modern-built by the Trinity Board in place
of two erected traditionally by an Abbess of Faversham, who
was wrecked here with her sister on their way to Broadstairs."
The sea is fast encroaching on the land here, notwithstanding
the erection of a large sea-wall and piles.</p>

<p>Passing Margate, we reach Broadstairs, about thirty-seven
miles from Chatham. Broadstairs, immortalized in <i>Our
English Watering Place</i> (which paper, says Forster, "appeared
while I was there, and great was the local excitement"),
is so inseparably associated with the earlier years of Charles
Dickens's holiday-life, that it becomes most interesting to his
admirers. Forster also says, "His later seaside holiday,
September 1837, was passed at Broadstairs, as were those of
many subsequent years; and the little watering-place has
been made memorable by his pleasant sketch of it." At the
time of his first visit (1837) he was writing a portion of
<i>Pickwick</i> (Part 18); in 1838 part of <i>Nicholas Nickleby;</i> and
in 1839 part of <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>. He was also there in
1840, 1841, and 1842, when writing the <i>American Notes;</i> in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
1845 and 1847, when writing <i>Dombey and Son;</i> in 1848 and
1850, when engaged on <i>David Copperfield;</i> and in 1851,
when he was drafting the outlines of <i>Bleak House</i>. At the
end of November of that year, when he had settled himself
in his new London abode (Tavistock House), the book was
begun, "and, as so generally happened with the more important
incidents of his life, but always accidentally, begun
on a Friday." After 1851, he returned not again to Broadstairs
until 1859, when he paid his last visit to the place,
and stayed a week there. The reason for his forsaking it
was that it had become too noisy for him.</p>

<p>Broadstairs stands midway between the North Foreland
and Ramsgate, and owes its name to the breadth of the sea-gate
or "stair," which was originally defended by a gate or
archway. An archway still survives on the road to the sea,
and bears on it two inscriptions, (1) "Built by George Culenier
about 1540"; (2) "Repaired by Sir John Henniker, Bart., 1795."</p>

<p>Broadstairs has good sands, precipitous chalk cliffs, and a
very fine sea-view. The railway station is about a mile from
the pier, and the town is approached by a well-kept road
("the main street of our watering-place.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You may know
it by its being always stopped up with donkey chaises.
Whenever you come here and see the harnessed donkeys
eating clover out of barrows drawn completely across a narrow
thoroughfare, you may be quite sure you are in our High
Street"), with villas standing in their own gardens, most of
which are brightened by summer flowers, notably the blue
clematis (<i>Clematis Jackmani</i>) and by those charming seaside
evergreens the <i>Escallonia</i> and the <i>Euonymus</i>. As we near the
sea, the shops become more numerous, and, on the right-hand
side, we have no difficulty in finding (although we heard it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
had been altered considerably) the house "No. 12, High
Street," in which Dickens lived when he first visited Broadstairs.
It is a plain little dwelling of single front, with a small
parlour looking into the street, and has one story over&mdash;just
the place that seems suited to the financial position of the
novelist when he was commencing life. The house is now
occupied by Mr. Bean, plumber and glazier, whose wife
courteously shows us over it, and into the back yard and
little garden, kindly giving us some pears from an old tree
growing there, whereon we speculate as to whether Dickens
himself had ever enjoyed the fruit from the same old tree. He
appears to have lived in this house during his visits in 1837
and 1838. We ask the good lady if she is aware that Charles
Dickens had formerly stayed in her house, and she replies in
the negative, so we recommend her to get her husband to put
up a tablet outside to the effect "Charles Dickens lived here,
1837," in imitation of the example of the Society of Arts in
Furnival's Inn. There can be no doubt as to the identity of
the house, for we take the precaution of ascertaining that the
numbers have not been altered.</p>

<p>Our efforts to discover "Lawn House," where Dickens
stayed on his visits from 1838 to 1848, are attended with
some difficulty. First we are told it lay this way, then that,
and then the other; a smart villa in a new road is pointed
out to us as the object of our search, which we at once reject,
as being too recent. But we are patient and persevering,
feeling, with Mr. F.'s aunt, that "you can't make a head and
brains out of a brass knob with nothing in it. You couldn't
do it when your Uncle George was living; much less when
he's dead!" Finally, we appeal to some one who looks like
the "oldest inhabitant," and obtain something like a clue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
We are eventually directed to a veritable "Lawn House,"
which is the last house on the left as you approach "Fort
House." It must have changed in respect of its surroundings
since forty years have passed, and although there is nothing
outside to indicate it as such, it seems fair to assume that this
was the house described in the <i>Life</i> as "a small villa between
the hill and the cornfield." The present occupier, who has
no recollection of Dickens ever having been there, courteously
allows us to see the hall and dining-room. The house is of
course a great improvement upon "No 12, High Street."</p>

<p>A few steps from "Lawn House" lead us to the drive approaching
"Fort House," pleasantly surrounded by a sloping
lawn and shrubbery. John Forster, alluding to it in the <i>Life</i>,
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The residence he most desired there, 'Fort House,' stood
prominently at the top of a breezy hill on the road to Kingsgate,
with a cornfield between it and the sea, and this in many
subsequent years he always occupied."</p>

<p>Alas! the cornfield is no more, but "Fort House," or "Bleak
House," as it is indifferently termed locally, remains intact.
It is the most striking object of the place, standing on a cliff
overlooking the sea, the harbour, and the town (made familiar
by several photographs and engravings), with its curious
verandahs and blinds, as seen in the vignette of J. C. Hotten's
interesting book, <i>Charles Dickens: The Story of His Life</i>. An
excellent photograph is published in the town, of which we
are glad to secure a copy.</p>


<p>In the sixth chapter of <i>Bleak House</i> it is called "an old-fashioned
house with three peaks in the roof in front, and a
severe sweep leading to the porch." In the same chapter there
is a minute account of the interior, too lengthy to be quoted;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
but the description does not resemble Fort House. We are
kindly permitted by the occupier to see the study in which the
novelist worked, a privilege long to be remembered. This
room is approached by "a little staircase of shallow steps"
from the first floor, as described in <i>Bleak House;</i> but it will be
borne in mind that the "Bleak House" of the novel is placed
in Hertfordshire, near St. Albans, and <i>not</i> at Broadstairs,
although many persons still believe that Fort House is the
original of the story. From the study we have a lovely view
of the sea&mdash;the balmy breeze of a summer's day lightly fanning
the waves, and just sufficing to move the delicate filamentous
foliage of the tamarisk trees now standing in the place
where the cornfield was. Even at the time we see it, changed
as all its surroundings are, we can imagine the enjoyment
which Dickens had in this healthy spot on the North Downs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_351.png" width="500" height="351" alt="&quot;Bleak House&quot; Broadstairs" title="" />
</div>

<p>In that interesting "book for an idle hour" called <i>The
Shuttlecock Papers</i>, Mr. J. Ashby-Sterry thus sympathetically
alludes to "Bleak House":&mdash;"What a romantic place this is
to write in, is it not? What a glorious study to work in!
Indeed, both from situation and association, it would be impossible
to find a better place for writing, were it not that one
feels that so much superb work has been done on this very
spot by so great an artist, that the mere craftsman is inclined
to question whether it is worth while for him to write at all."</p>

<p>How well Dickens loved Broadstairs is told in his letter of
the 1st September, 1843, addressed to Professor Felton, of
Cambridge, U. S. A., as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is a little fishing-place; intensely quiet; built on a
cliff, whereon&mdash;in the centre of a tiny semi-circular bay&mdash;our
house stands; the sea rolling and dashing under the windows.
Seven miles out are the Goodwin Sands (you've heard of the
Goodwin Sands?), whence floating lights perpetually wink
after dark, as if they were carrying on intrigues with the
servants. Also there is a lighthouse called the North Foreland
on a hill behind the village, a severe parsonic light, which
reproves the young and giddy floaters, and stares grimly out
upon the sea. Under the cliff are rare good sands, where all
the children assemble every morning and throw up impossible
fortifications, which the sea throws down again at high-water.
Old gentlemen and ancient ladies flirt after their own manner
in two reading-rooms, and on a great many scattered seats in
the open air. Other old gentlemen look all day long through
telescopes and never see anything.</p>

<p>"In a bay-window in a one-pair sits, from nine o'clock to
one, a gentleman with rather long hair and no neckcloth, who
writes and grins as if he thought he were very funny indeed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
His name is Boz. At one he disappears, and presently
emerges from a bathing machine, and may be seen&mdash;a kind
of salmon-coloured porpoise&mdash;splashing about in the ocean.
After that he may be seen in another bay-window on the
ground-floor, eating a strong lunch; after that, walking a
dozen miles or so, or lying on his back in the sand reading a
book. Nobody bothers him unless they know he is disposed
to be talked to; and I am told he is very comfortable indeed.
He's as brown as a berry, and they <i>do</i> say is a small fortune
to the innkeeper who sells beer and cold punch. But this is
mere rumour. Sometimes he goes up to London (eighty
miles or so away), and then I'm told there is a sound in
Lincoln's Inn Fields at night, as of men laughing, together
with a clinking of knives and forks, and wine-glasses."</p>

<p>And further in a letter to another correspondent recently
made public:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When you come to London, to assist at Miss Liston's
sacrifice, don't forget to remind your uncle of our Broadstairs
engagement to which I hold you bound. A good sea&mdash;fresh
breezes&mdash;fine sands&mdash;and pleasant walks&mdash;with all manner of
fishing-boats, lighthouses, piers, bathing-machines, are its only
attractions, but it's one of the freshest little places in the
world, consequently the proper place for you."</p>

<p>In the year 1851, in a letter dated 8th September, addressed
to Mr. Henry Austin, he thus alludes to a wreck which took
place at Broadstairs:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A great to-do here. A steamer lost on the Goodwins
yesterday, and our men bringing in no end of dead cattle and
sheep. I stood supper for them last night, to the unbounded
gratification of Broadstairs. They came in from the wreck
very wet and tired, and very much disconcerted by the nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
of their prize&mdash;which, I suppose after all, will have to be
recommitted to the sea, when the hides and tallow are
secured. One lean-faced boatman murmured, when they
were all ruminating over the bodies as they lay on the pier:
'Couldn't sassages be made on it?' but retired in confusion
shortly afterwards, overwhelmed by the execrations of the
bystanders."</p>

<p>Dickens got tired of Broadstairs in 1847, for reasons given
in the following letter to Forster, though he did not forsake
it till some years after:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Vagrant music is getting to that height here, and is so
impossible to be escaped from, that I fear Broadstairs and
I must part company in time to come. Unless it pours of
rain, I cannot write half an hour without the most excruciating
organs, fiddles, bells, or glee singers. There is a violin
of the most torturing kind under the window now (time, ten
in the morning), and an Italian box of music on the steps&mdash;both
in full blast."</p>

<p>By good luck we fall in with an "old salt," formerly one
of the boatmen of <i>Our English Watering Place</i> who are
therein immortalized by much kindly mention, with whom
we have a pleasant chat about Charles Dickens. Harry Ford
(the name of our friend) well remembers the great novelist,
when in early days he used to come on his annual excursions
with his family to Broadstairs. "Bless your soul," he says,
"I can see 'Old Charley,' as we used to call him among ourselves
here, a-coming flying down from the cliff with a hop,
step, and jump, with his hair all flying about. He used to
sit sometimes on that rail" (pointing to the one surrounding
the harbour), "with his legs lolling about, and sometimes
on the seat that you're a-sitting on now" (adjoining the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
old Look-out House opposite the Tartar Frigate Inn), "and
he was very fond of talking to us fellows and hearing our
tales&mdash;he was very good-natured, and nobody was liked
better. And if you'll read" (continues our informant) "that
story that he wrote and printed about <i>Our Watering Place</i>,
<i>I</i> was the man who's mentioned there as mending a little
ship for a boy. <i>I</i> held that child between my knees. And
what's more, sir, <i>I</i> took 'Old Charley,' on the very last
time that he came over to Broadstairs (he wasn't living
here at the time), round the foreland to Margate, with a
party of four friends. I took 'em in my boat, the <i>Irene</i>,"
pointing to a clinker-built strong boat lying in the harbour,
capable of holding twenty people. "The wind was easterly&mdash;the
weather was rather rough, and it took me three or
four hours to get round. There was a good deal of chaffing
going on, I can tell you."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_355.png" width="500" height="318" alt="Old Look-out House Broadstairs" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Long, of Zion Place, Broadstairs, the wife of an old
coastguardman, who was stationed at the Preventive Station
when Dickens lodged at Fort House, also remembered the
novelist. The coastguard men are also immortalized in <i>Our
English Watering Place</i>, as "a steady, trusty, well-conditioned,
well-conducted set of men, with no misgiving about looking
you full in the face, and with a quiet, thorough-going way
of passing along to their duty at night, carrying huge sou'wester
clothing in reserve, that is fraught with all good prepossession.
They are handy fellows&mdash;neat about their houses,
industrious at gardening, would get on with their wives, one
thinks, in a desert island&mdash;and people it too soon."</p>

<p>Mrs. Long says "Mr. Dickens was a very nice sort of
gentleman, but he didn't like a noise." The windows of Fort
House, she reminds us, overlooked the coastguard station, and
whenever the children playing about made more noise than
usual, he used to tell her husband gently "to take the children
away," or "to keep the people quiet." This little story fully
confirms Dickens's often-expressed feeling of dislike, which
subsequently grew intolerable, to Broadstairs as a watering-place.</p>

<p>After taking a turn or two on the lively Promenade,&mdash;made
bright by the rich masses of flesh-coloured flowers of the
valerian which fringe its margin,&mdash;to enjoy the sunshine and
air, and watch the holiday folks, we bid adieu to Broadstairs,
and proceed to Margate.</p>

<p>Of Margate there is not much to say. We reach it by an
early afternoon train of the London, Chatham, and Dover
Railway, to get the quickest service by the South-Eastern
Railway on to Canterbury. Our stay at Margate is consequently
very limited.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>To some minds this popular Cockney watering-place has
great attractions; its broad sands, its beautiful air, and its
boisterous amusements, negro-melodies, merry-go-rounds, and
the like; but it was a place seldom visited by Dickens,
although he was so often near it. Only twice in the <i>Life</i>
is it recorded that he came here; once being in 1844, when
he wrote to Forster respecting the theatre as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'<i>Nota Bene.</i>&mdash;The Margate Theatre is open every evening,
and the four Patagonians (see Goldsmith's <i>Essays</i>) are performing
thrice a week at Ranelagh.' A visit from me"&mdash;Forster
goes on to say&mdash;"was at this time due, to which these
were held out as inducements; and there followed what it was
supposed I could not resist, a transformation into the broadest
farce of a deep tragedy by a dear friend of ours. 'Now
you really must come. Seeing only is believing, very often
isn't that, and even Being the thing falls a long way short of
believing it. Mrs. Nickleby herself once asked me, as you
know, if I really believed there ever was such a woman; but
there will be no more belief, either in me or my descriptions,
after what I have to tell of our excellent friend's tragedy, if
you don't come and have it played again for yourself, 'by
particular desire.' We saw it last night, and oh! if you had
but been with us! Young Betty, doing what the mind of man
without my help never <i>can</i> conceive, with his legs like padded
boot-trees wrapped up in faded yellow drawers, was the hero.
The comic man of the company, enveloped in a white sheet,
with his head tied with red tape like a brief, and greeted with
yells of laughter whenever he appeared, was the venerable
priest. A poor toothless old idiot, at whom the very gallery
roared with contempt when he was called a tyrant, was the
remorseless and aged Creon. And Ismene, being arrayed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
spangled muslin trousers very loose in the legs and very tight
in the ankles, such as Fatima would wear in <i>Blue Beard</i>, was
at her appearance immediately called upon for a song! After
this can you longer&mdash;?'"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_358.png" width="500" height="349" alt="The &quot;Falstaff&quot;: Westgate Canterbury" title="" />
</div>

<p>He speaks in a letter to Forster, dated September, 1847,
of "improvements in the Margate Theatre since his memorable
first visit." It had been managed by a son of the great
comedian Dowton, and the piece which Dickens then saw was
<i>As You Like It</i>, "really very well done, and a most excellent
house." It was Mr. Dowton's benefit, and "he made a sensible
and modest kind of speech," which impressed Dickens,
who thus concludes his letter:&mdash;"He really seems a most
respectable man, and he has cleaned out this dusthole of a
theatre into something like decency."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>There is also the following significant mention of Margate
in chapter nineteen of <i>Bleak House:</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is the hottest long vacation known for many years. All
the young clerks are madly in love, and according to their
various degrees, pant for bliss with the beloved object at
Margate, Ramsgate, or Gravesend."</p>

<p>If Broadstairs was noisy, Margate must have been intensely
so. We leave the crowded holiday-making place without
much feeling of regret, and passing Ramsgate&mdash;of which
there is but one mention in the <i>Life</i>&mdash;on our way, reach
Canterbury in the afternoon.</p>

<p>We are delighted with this exquisitely beautiful old city,
our only regret being that our time is very limited, and our
means of ascertaining places situated in "Dickens-Land"
more so.</p>

<p>Taking up our temporary quarters at the "Sir John Falstaff"
Hotel, in remembrance of its namesake at Gad's Hill, after
the refreshment of a meal, we commence our tramp through
Canterbury, where David Copperfield passed some of his
happiest days. Of the Falstaff here there is an excellent
picture in Mr. Rimmer's <i>About England with Dickens;</i> a
very quaint old inn with double front, and bay-windows top
and bottom, possibly of the sixteenth century, and with a
long swinging sign extending over the pavement, on which is
painted a life-like presentment of the portly knight, the
pretty ornamental ironwork supporting it reminding one of
Washington Irving's description in <i>Bracebridge Hall</i>, "fancifully
wrought at top into flourishes and flowers."</p>

<p>A few steps further on is the West Gate, "standing between
two lofty and spacious round towers erected in the river,"
built by Archbishop Sudbury, who was barbarously murdered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
by Wat Tyler in the reign of Richard II., which is the sole
remaining one of six gates formerly constituting the approaches
to the city. From this gate, looking eastward,
with the river Stour on either side, banked by neatly-trimmed
private gardens, a beautiful view of the city is obtained. The
High Street, crowded with gables of the sixteenth century
and later timbered houses, slightly bends and rises as well,
until the perspective seems to lose itself in a distant grove
of trees, locally called the "Dane John," a corruption of
"Donjon." This view, especially when seen on a summer
afternoon, is most picturesque. The present appearance of the
quiet street is decidedly unlike that which it presented on
that busy market-day when Miss Betsey Trotwood drove her
nephew along it, for David says, "My aunt had a good
opportunity of insinuating the grey pony among carts,
baskets, vegetables, and hucksters' goods. The hair-breadth
turns and twists we made drew down upon us a variety of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
speeches from the people standing about, which were not
always complimentary; but my aunt drove on with perfect
indifference."</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_360.png" width="500" height="306" alt="The &quot;Dane John&quot; from the City Wall Canterbury" title="" />
</div>


<p>We notice in the windows and in many of the shops an
abundance of brightly-coloured cut-flowers, a notable feature
of the county of Kent; but we have little time to spare, and
hasten on to the Cathedral precincts.</p>

<p>"What a magnificent edifice!" is our first thought on
beholding the Cathedral, a noble pile so well befitting the
Metropolitan See of England, from which the Christianity of
the Kingdom first flowed. Dating from Ethelbert, at the
close of the sixth century, three structures have successively
occupied the site, culminating in the present one, which,
according to Mr. Phillips Bevan, was erected at different
times between 1070 and 1500; and he goes on to say:&mdash;"No
wonder that it exhibits so many styles and peculiarities of
detail, although the two most prominent architectural eras
are those of 'Transition-Norman' and 'Perpendicular.'"</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 399px;"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a>
<img src="images/i_362.png" width="399" height="600" alt="Bell Harry Tower: Canterbury Cathedral:" title="" />
</div>

<p>The appropriate stone figures in niches of distinguished
Royal and Ecclesiastical personages associated with the
Cathedral (which at the suggestion of Dean Alford in 1863
replaced those of the murderers of the martyr, Thomas &agrave;
Becket), from King Ethelbert to Queen Victoria, and from
Archbishop Lanfranc to Archbishop Longley; the lofty
groined arches and stately towers, the beautiful carved screen,
the noble monuments, the splendid choir (a hundred and
eighty feet in length) approached by many steps, the rich
stained-glass windows, all attract our admiring attention, and
confirm our impression that a modern pilgrimage to Canterbury
is a thing to be highly appreciated; and on no account would
we have missed this part of our excursion. The murder of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Thomas &agrave; Becket (1170) took place between the nave
and the choir in a transept or cross aisle called "The
Martyrdom."</p>


<p>There is an interesting Sidney Cooper Gallery of Art, and
also a Museum in the city, the latter containing some rare old
Roman Mosaic pavement discovered in Burgate Street at a
depth of ten feet.</p>

<p>But our object is to identify spots made memorable in
<i>David Copperfield</i>, and we walk round the spacious Cathedral
Close and "make an effort" (as Mrs. Chick said) in trying to
find the simple-minded and good Dr. Strong's House. It is
described as "a grave building in a courtyard, with a learned
air about it that seemed very well suited to the stray rooks
and jackdaws who came down from the Cathedral towers,
and walked with a clerkly bearing on the grass-plat."</p>

<p>Alas! it is not here, although there are many such houses
that correspond with it in some particulars. So we try
several of the "dear old tranquil streets," but fail to discover
the identical building.</p>

</div>

<p>The next object of our search is Mr. Wickfield's residence,
"a very old house bulging out over the road; a house with
low latticed windows, bulging out still further, and beams
with carved heads on the ends, bulging out too." How
strongly the description in many parts tallies with the houses
in Rochester opposite "Eastgate House"; but here again we
are baffled, as other modern pilgrims have been before, and
we cannot associate any particular building with either of
the two houses. The house in Burgate Street now occupied
as offices by Messrs. Plummer and Fielding, Diocesan
Registrars, who obligingly permit an examination of it,
is suggested to us as being Mr. Wickfield's house, but, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
an inspection, on several grounds we are obliged to reject this
suggestion.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Bits&quot; of Old Canterbury.</span>
</div>

<p>There was many a "low
old-fashioned room, walked
straight into from the
street," which would have
served for the "umble"
dwelling of Uriah Heep
and his mother, but none
can be pointed out with
absolute certainty
as being the
veritable one.</p>

<p>By the
kindness of
Dr. Sheppard
and Mr. T. B. Rosseter, F.R.M.S., we are, however, enabled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
to identify two houses in Canterbury alluded to in <i>David
Copperfield</i>. The "County Inn," where Mr. Dick slept on
his visits to David "every alternate Wednesday," was no
doubt The Royal Fountain Hotel in St. Margaret's Street
(formerly the Watling Street), which is still recognized as
such. A passage in the seventeenth chapter thus refers to
these visits:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mr. Dick was very partial to ginger-bread. To render his visits
the more agreeable, my aunt had instructed me to open a credit for
him at a cake-shop, which was hampered with the stipulation that he
should not be served with more than one shilling's-worth in the
course of any one day. This, and the reference of all his little bills
at the County Inn, where he slept, to my aunt before they were
paid, induced me to think that Mr. Dick was only allowed to rattle
his money, and not to spend it."</p></div>

<p>The "little Inn" (as recorded in the same chapter) where
Mr. Micawber "put up" on his first visit to Canterbury, and
where he "occupied a little room in it partitioned off from
the commercial, and strongly flavoured with tobacco smoke,"
is doubtless the "Sun Inn" in Sun Street, which is at the
opposite corner of the square where the ancient "Chequers"
in Mercery Lane&mdash;the Pilgrim's Inn of Chaucer&mdash;stood. It
was a place of resort from afar, and was altered in the
seventeenth century. Dr. Sheppard calls attention to the
interesting fact that the omnibus from Herne Bay stopped at
the Sun; and probably, in his visits to Broadstairs, Dickens
would often run over for a day's trip to Canterbury.</p>

<p>On their first visit to the "little Inn," Mr. and Mrs.
Micawber&mdash;notwithstanding their chronic impecuniosity&mdash;thus
entertained David Copperfield:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We had a beautiful little dinner. Quite an elegant dish of fish;
the kidney end of a loin of veal roasted; fried sausage-meat; a
partridge and a pudding. There was wine, and there was strong
ale; and after dinner Mrs. Micawber made us a bowl of hot punch
with her own hands."</p></div>

<p>They spent a jolly evening, and ended with singing <i>Auld
Lang Syne</i>.</p>

<p>The "little Inn" is again alluded to later in the story,
where Mr. Micawber announces his full determination to
abstain from everything until he has exposed the machinations
of, and blown to pieces, "the&mdash;a&mdash;detestable serpent&mdash;<span class="smcap">Heep</span>;"
and finally, where David Copperfield "assisted at
an explosion," and Mr. Micawber is triumphant, and the
"transcendent and immortal hypocrite and perjurer, <span class="smcap">Heep</span>,"
is forced to succumb.</p>

<p>Speaking of the "little Inn" for the last time, David
says:&mdash;"I looked at the old house from the corner of the
street.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The early sun was striking edgewise on its gables
and lattice-windows, touching them with gold; and some
beams of its old peace seemed to touch my heart."</p>

<p>Dr. Sheppard subsequently told us that, when he was
beginning to turn his attention to the deciphering and
utilizing of ancient MSS., he was much impressed, when
perusing some articles in <i>Household Words</i>, or some other
papers written by Dickens, relating to the neglected state
of public records, more particularly at Canterbury; and
when many years after the very records of which he wrote
came under his (Dr. Sheppard's) care, he was surprised to
find the names of Snodgrass, Sam Weller, and others therein.
The records to which Dr. Sheppard referred were those in
charge of the Archbishop's Registrar at Canterbury.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>If time permits it would be pleasant to go on to Dover,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
to see "Miss Betsey Trotwood's house," but this is impossible;
and indeed, all that can be said about a tramp
in search of "that very neat little cottage with cheerful
bow windows in front of it, a small square gravelled court
or garden full of flowers carefully tended, and smelling
deliciously," has been well said by Mr. Ashby-Sterry in his
delightful little volume, <i>Cucumber Chronicles</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_368.png" width="500" height="466" alt="&quot;The Little Inn&quot; Canterbury" title="" />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>
<p>After much perseverance, and in spite of almost as many difficulties
as beset poor little David Copperfield himself in his
search for his aunt (who, as the Dover boatmen told him, "lived
in the South Foreland Light, and had singed her whiskers by
doing so"&mdash;"that she was made fast to the great buoy outside
the harbour, and could only be visited at half-tide"&mdash;"that
she was locked up in Maidstone Jail for child-stealing"&mdash;and
that "she was seen to mount a broom in the last high wind
and make direct for Calais"), Mr. Ashby-Sterry succeeded,
although his greatest embarrassment arose from that irrepressible
nuisance, "Buggins the Builder," who cannot be
controlled even in the neighbourhood of Dover, so "hugely
does he delight to mar those spots that have been hallowed
by antiquity, seclusion, or the pen of the novelist. Hence the
abode of Betsey Trotwood is not so pleasant as it must have
been formerly, for other houses have clustered about the back
and the front." But Mr. Ashby-Sterry quite satisfied himself
as to the identity on Dover Heights of the very neat little
cottage, and assures us that "the house, however, still stands
high, the fresh breezes from over the sea and across the Down
smite it. It still has a view of the sea, though perhaps not so
uninterrupted as it was in the days of David Copperfield."
He further states that it is, perhaps, not quite so neat as it
was in Miss Betsey Trotwood's time, though there are no
donkeys about. Here are the bow windows, with the room
above, where Mr. Dick alarmed poor David by nodding and
laughing at him on his first arrival. The window on the
right must have belonged to the neat room "with the drugget-covered
carpet," and the old-fashioned furniture brightly
polished, where might be found "the cat, the kettle-holder,
the two canaries, the old china, the punch-bowl full of dried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
rose leaves, the tall press guarding all sorts of bottles and
pots, and wonderfully out of keeping with the rest." On the
strength of this description by an ardent lover of Dickens, we
fully make up our minds to visit Dover at no distant date to
see Miss Betsey Trotwood's house for ourselves.</p>

<p><i>&Agrave; propos</i> of Miss Trotwood's domicile, we have been
favoured by Mr. C. K. Worsfold, an old resident of Dover,
with a letter containing some interesting particulars, from
which we extract the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dickens's description of the local habitation of Betsey
Trotwood is not consistent with the surroundings. The hills
on either side of the town belong to the War Department,
and are occupied as fortifications; on the eastern side is the
Castle, and on the western side barracks and forts. On the
western heights there is a house somewhat answering to
Dickens's description, having a garden in front of it, and a
small plot of grass in front of the garden; and about forty
years ago there lived in this house a lady of rather masculine
character, who always resented any intrusion of boys, and
perhaps donkeys, on the grass in front of her house and
garden, and I believe she was occasionally rather rough with
the boys; but there the likeness to Betsey Trotwood ends.
This was a married lady living with her husband.</p>

<p>"I know it was a matter of conversation forty years ago
that Dickens must have found his original in the lady in
question, but I think he was rather in the habit of selecting
his characters without reference to locality, and then adapting
them to his requirements.</p>

<p>"Dickens was a frequent visitor to Dover, and he may
possibly have been a witness of some encounter between this
lady and the boys, and on that occasion donkeys may have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
been present.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> I do not know of any relative of the lady
answering to Miss Trotwood's worthy nephew."</p>

<p>"A moderate stroke," as Mr. Datchery said, "is all I am
justified in scoring up"; and we reluctantly leave the "sunny
street of Canterbury, dozing, as it were, in the hot light," and
take our places in the train for Chatham, distant about
twenty-seven miles.</p>

<p>The only new parts of interest which we go over, on our
return journey by rail, are the green fields surrounding the
ancient city, wherein are numbers of those beautiful and
quiet-feeding cattle, which the eminent artist, Mr. T. Sidney
Cooper, R.A. (who resides in the neighbourhood), loves to
paint, and paints so well; and in due time we pass the
chalk-topped hills called Harbledown, overlooking Canterbury,
from whence the best view of the city is obtained, and
safely reach our headquarters at Rochester.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>COOLING, CLIFFE, AND HIGHAM.</h3>

<div class="hang2">"And now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the
ships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the Churchyard
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of
clouds and trees."</div>

<div class='center'><br /><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"What might have been your opinion of the place?"</p>

<p>"A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp and work; work,
swamp, mist, and mudbank."&mdash;<i>Great Expectations.</i></p></div>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<div class="hang2">"They were now in the open country; the houses were very few and
scattered at long intervals, often miles apart. Occasionally they came
upon a cluster of poor cottages, some with a chair or low board put
across the open door, to keep the scrambling children from the road;
others shut up close, while all the family were working in the fields.
These were often the commencement of a little village; and after an
interval came a wheelwright's shed, or perhaps a blacksmith's forge;
then a thriving farm, with sleepy cows lying about the yard, and horses
peering over the low wall, and scampering away when harnessed horses
passed upon the road, as though in triumph at their freedom."&mdash;<i>The Old
Curiosity Shop.</i></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Now</span> for a long tramp in the country of the Marshes&mdash;the
famous "Meshes" of <i>Great Expectations</i>. The air is sultry
on this Thursday afternoon, and there is thunder in the
distance. The storm, however, does not pass over Rochester,
but further on we find traces of it where the roadways have
been washed up. Afterwards the air becomes deliciously
cool, and that hum of all Nature which succeeds the quiet
preceding the storm is distinctly perceptible. Crossing
Rochester Bridge, keeping to the right along Strood and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Frindsbury&mdash;the churchyard of which affords a splendid
view of Rochester, Chatham, and the Medway&mdash;passing
up Four Elms Hill and through the little village of
Wainscot, nothing of interest calls for notice until we
have travelled some miles from Strood. After crossing
a tramway belonging to Government, and utilized by the
Royal Engineers as a means of communication between
the powder-magazine and Chatham Barracks, we observe
that vegetation, which is so rich in other parts of Kent,
here appears to be dwarfed and stunted. A hop-garden
presents a very miserable contrast, in its struggle for existence,
to others we have seen in the more central parts of
the county, and even some of these were far from being
luxuriant, owing to such a peculiarly wet and cold season.
The hedges in places are diversified with the small gold and
violet star-like flowers and the green and scarlet berries of
the climbing woody nightshade, or bitter-sweet (<i>Solanum
Dulcamara</i>), often mistaken for the deadly nightshade (<i>Atropa
Belladonna</i>&mdash;a fine bushy herbaceous perennial, with large
ovate-shaped leaves, and lurid, purple bell-shaped flowers),
quite a different plant, and happily somewhat rare in
England. The delicate light-blue flowers of the chicory are
very abundant here.</div>

<p>A tramp of upwards of six miles from Rochester, by way of
Hoo,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> brings us to Lodge Hill, overlooking Perry Hill, which
affords a magnificent view of the mouth of the Thames
beyond the low-lying Marshes, and of Canvey Island, off the
coast of Essex, on the opposite side. By the kindness of a
farmer's wife we are allowed to take a short cut through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
the farm-garden and grounds, which leads direct to Cooling
(or Cowling) Church, a cheerless, grey-stone structure, the
tower standing out as a beacon long before we reach it.</p>

<p>Those unacquainted with this part of Kent may be interested
in knowing that the Marshes, which stretch out over
a considerable distance on either side of the Thames, on both
the Kent and the Essex coasts, consist entirely of alluvial soil
reclaimed at some time from the river. They are intersected by
ditches and water-courses, and covered with rank vegetation,
chiefly of grass, rushes, and flags, where not cultivated. Higher
up the land is rich, and large tracts of it are planted with
vegetables as market gardens. Sea-gulls, plovers, and herons
are numerous; their call-notes in the still evening sounding
shrill and uncanny over the long stretches of flat lands.</p>

<p>Dear old Michael Drayton, the Warwickshire poet, who
touched upon almost everything, has not omitted to describe
the Marshes in a somewhat similar locality, for in the
<i>Polyolbion</i> (Song XVIII.) he gracefully compares them to a
female enamoured of the beauties of the River Rother, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Appearing to the flood, most bravely like a Queen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Clad all from head to foot, in gaudy Summer's green,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Her mantle richly wrought with sundry flow'rs and weeds;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Her moistful temples bound with wreaths of quiv'ring reeds;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And on her loins a frock, with many a swelling plait,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Emboss'd with well-spread horse, large sheep, and full-fed neat;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With villages amongst, oft powthered here and there;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And (that the same more like to landscape should appear)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With lakes and lesser fords, to mitigate the heat</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In summer, when the fly doth prick the gadding neat."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Readers of <i>Great Expectations</i> will remember that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
scene in the first chapter between Pip and the convict,
Magwitch, is laid in Cooling churchyard, and on reaching
this spot we are instantly reminded of what doubtless gave
origin to the idea of the five dead little brothers of poor
Philip Pirrip, for there, on the left of the principal pathway,
are indeed, not five stone lozenges, but <i>ten</i> in one row and
three more at the back of them, such peculiarly-shaped and
curiously-arranged little monuments as we never before beheld.
They consist of a grey stone (Kentish-rag, probably,
but lichen-encrusted by time) of cylindrical shape, widening
at the shoulders, coffin-like, and about a yard in length, the
diameter being about eight inches, including the portion
buried in the earth. Four little foot-stones are placed in
front, and separating the ten little memorials from the three
at the back is a large head-stone, bearing the name&mdash;"Comport
of Cowling Court, 1771." Cooling Church, which
has the date 1615 on one of the bells, has an example of
a Hagioscope, a curious, small, square, angular, tunnel-like
opening through the wall, which divides the nave from the
chancel. It is said to have been the place through which
those members of the church, who were unworthy or unable
to receive the sacred elements, might get a look at their
more acceptable companions during the administration of
the sacrament. The Rev. W. H. A. Leaver, the Rector, who
kindly shows us over his church, in reply to our question as
to whether he could give any information about Charles
Dickens, said that he was a new-comer in the district, and
that all he remembers is, that when his sister was a little
baby in arms, her mother happened once to be travelling in
the same train with the great novelist, who, with his usual
kindness, gave the child an orange, which she acknowledged
very ungratefully by scratching his face!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is a picture of the neighbourhood, given in
the opening sentences of the story:&mdash;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">
<img src="images/i_376.png" width="475" height="363" alt="Graves of the Comport Family: in Cooling Churchyard" title="" />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the
river wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad
impression of the identity of things, seems to me to have been gained
on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time, I
found out for certain, that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was
the churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also
Georgiana, wife of above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander,
Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the
aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness
beyond the churchyard, intersected with dykes, and mounds,
and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and
that the low leaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant
savage lair, from which the wind was rushing, was the sea; and that
the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all, and beginning to
cry, was Pip."</p></div>


<p>Here follows the appearance of the awful convict, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
terrible threats by which he induces Pip to bring him "that
file and them wittles" on the morrow; to enforce obedience
the convict tilts Pip two or three times, "and then" [says Pip]
"he gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the
church jumped over its own weathercock." Then he held
him by the arms in an upright position on the top of the
stone, finally threatening him "with having his heart and liver
torn out," in case of non-compliance.</p>

<p>All the characters described in <i>Great Expectations</i>, and all
the scenes wherein they played their parts&mdash;Pip, with and
without his "great expectations"; his sister Mrs. Joe
Gargery, "on the rampage with Tickler;" Joe Gargery, "ever
the best of friends, dear Pip;" Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, the
former fond of "a bit of savoury pork pie as would lay atop of
anything you could mention and do no harm;" the stage-struck
Wopsle, <i>alias</i> "Mr. Waldengarver"; "the servile
Pumblechook;" the two convicts, "Pip's convict," Magwitch,
with "the great iron on his leg," and the "other convict,"
Compeyson, also ironed; "slouching old" Orlick; Biddy,
simple-hearted and loving; "the Serjeant" and "party of
soldiers"; Mr. Jaggers, "the Old Bailey lawyer"; Estella,
Miss Havisham, Herbert Pocket, and Bentley Drummle at
"the market town"; Joe's Forge (now converted into a
dwelling-house); "The Three Jolly Bargemen" (obviously
taken from "The Three Horse-shoes," the present village
inn); the "old Battery," "the little sluice-house by the lime-kiln;"&mdash;all
centre round Cooling churchyard, and appear
before us as though traced on a map.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a>
<img src="images/i_378.png" width="500" height="392" alt="Cooling Church." title="" />
<span class="caption">Cooling Church.</span>
</div>

<p>Forster says in the <i>Life:</i>&mdash;"It is strange as I transcribe the
words, with what wonderful vividness they bring back the very
spot on which we stood when he said he meant to make it the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
scene of the opening of this story&mdash;Cooling Castle ruins and
the desolate Church, lying out among the marshes seven miles
from Gad's Hill!"</p>


<p>Beyond where the river runs to the sea, we conjure up the
chase and recapture of Pip's convict, while poor Pip himself,
assisted by his friend Herbert Pocket, is straining every nerve
to get him away. As illustrative of the wonderfully careful
way in which Dickens did all his work, we also read in
Forster's <i>Life:</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>"To make himself sure of the actual course of a boat in
such circumstances, and what possible incidents the adventure
might have, Dickens hired a steamer for the day from Blackwall
to Southend. Eight or nine friends, and three or four
members of his family, were on board, and he seemed to have
no care, the whole of that summer day (22nd of May, 1861),
except to enjoy their enjoyment and entertain them with his
own in shape of a thousand whims and fancies; but his sleepless
observation was at work all the time, and nothing had
escaped his keen vision on either side of the river. The
fifteenth chapter of the third volume is a masterpiece."</p>

<p>Speaking generally of this fascinating story, which possesses
a thousand-fold greater interest to us now we visit the country
there described (not formerly very accessible, but now readily
approached by the railway from Gravesend to Sheerness, alighting
at Cliffe, the nearest station to Cooling), Forster says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It may be doubted if Dickens could better have established
his right to the front rank among novelists claimed for
him, than by the ease and mastery with which, in these two
books of <i>Copperfield</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i>, he kept perfectly
distinct the two stories of a boy's childhood, both told in the
form of autobiography."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>The marshes are also alluded to twice in <i>Bleak House</i>&mdash;first,
in chapter one&mdash;"Fog on the Essex marshes, fog on the
Kentish heights;" and secondly, in the twenty-sixth chapter,
in the dialogue between Trooper George and his odd but kind-hearted
attendant Phil Squod, the original of which, by the
bye, was a Chatham character.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'And so, Phil,' says George of the shooting gallery, after several
turns in silence; 'you were dreaming of the country last night.'</p>

<p>"Phil, by the bye, said as much, in a tone of surprise, as he
scrambled out of bed.</p>

<p>"'Yes, guv'ner.'</p>

<p>"'What was it like?'</p>

<p>"'I hardly know what it was like, guv'ner,' said Phil, considering.</p>

<p>"'How did you know it was the country?'</p>

<p>"'On accounts of the grass, I think. And the swans upon it,' says
Phil, after further consideration.</p>

<p>"'What were the swans doing on the grass?'</p>

<p>"'They was a eating of it, I expect,' says Phil.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"'The country,' says Mr. George, applying his knife and fork,
'why I suppose you never clapped your eyes on the country, Phil?'</p>

<p>"'I see the marshes once,' says Phil, contentedly eating his
breakfast.</p>

<p>"'What marshes?'</p>

<p>"'<i>The</i> marshes, commander,' returns Phil.</p>

<p>"'Where are they?'</p>

<p>"'I don't know where they are,' says Phil, 'but I see 'em, guv'ner.
They was flat. And miste.'"</p></div>

<p>Forster says:&mdash;"About the whole of this Cooling churchyard,
indeed, and the neighbouring castle ruins, there was a
weird strangeness that made it one of his [Dickens's] attractive
walks in the late year or winter, when from Higham he could
get to it across country, over the stubble fields; and, for a
shorter summer walk, he was not less fond of going round the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
village of Shorne, and sitting on a hot afternoon in its pretty
shady churchyard."</p>

<p>Altogether, the place has a dreary and lonesome appearance
in the close of the summer evening, and we can picture
with wonderful vividness the remarkable scenes described in
<i>Great Expectations</i>, as the lurid purple reflection from the
setting sun spreads over the Thames valley, and lights up the
marshes; the tall pollards standing out like spectres contribute
to the weirdness and beauty of the scene.</p>

<p>Dickens was not the only admirer of the Marshes. Turner
also visited them, and painted some of his most famous
pictures from observation there, namely "Stangate Creek,"
"Shrimping Sands," and "Off Sheerness."</p>

<p>A few paces from the church brings us to Cooling Castle,
built by Sir John de Cobham, the third Baron Cobham, in
the reign of Richard II., whose arms appear on the gatehouse,
together with a very curious motto in early English
characters. We extract the following interesting account of
the tower from the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia Cantiana</i> (vol. xi.):&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a>
<img src="images/i_382.png" width="550" height="406" alt="Gateway Cooling Castle" title="" />
</div>

<p>"On the south face of the eastern Outer Gate Tower, we
see the well-known inscription, which takes the form of a
Charter, with Lord Cobham's seal appended to it. This is
formed of fourteen copper plates exquisitely enamelled. The
writing is in black, while the ground is of white enamel; the
seal and silk cords are of the proper colours. The whole work
is an exquisite example of enamel, which after five hundred
years' exposure to the weather remains nearly as good as
when it was put up. The inscription states very clearly why
Lord Cobham erected a castle here, viz. for the safety of the
country. The French invasion had shewn the need, and the
inscription was perhaps intended to disarm the suspicions and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
hostility of the serfs by reminding them of that need. It
runs thus, in four lines, each enamelled upon three plates of
copper:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Knoweth that beth and schul be<br />

</div>

<p>"(Seal, 'gules', on a chevron 'or' three lions rampant

<p>"Inscriptions are rare on Gothic buildings, especially on
castles. This at Coulyng is remarkable from being in English,
at a time when Latin was employed in all charters; it
contains that early form of the plural 'beth' instead of 'are.'
The inscription measures thirty-two inches by fourteen, and
the diameter of the seal is no less than seven and a quarter
inches long."</p>

<p>After stopping a short time to admire the imposing entrance
gate and the remains of the ancient moat, we wend our way
for two or three miles, by lanes and "over the stubble-fields,"
to the straggling village of Cliffe,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> the houses of which are
very old and mostly weather-boarded. The approach to the
church is by a rare example of a lich-gate, having a room
over it for muniments, and the church itself (which is very
large, and seems to be out of proportion to the size of the
village) stands in a commanding position on a ridge of chalk,
overlooking the marshes, from whence the views of the river<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
in the distance are very fine. It is supposed to be the place
where the Saxon Church held its councils, and there is a local
tradition of a ferry having once existed near here. Evidence
of this seems to survive in the fact that all the roads both on
the Kent and Essex shores appear to converge to this point.
The church has some interesting <i>miserere</i> stalls and brasses
to the Faunce family (17th century). On the walls we find
specimens of that somewhat rare fern, the scaly spleenwort
(<i>Ceterach officinarum</i>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_384.png" width="500" height="475" alt="Cliffe Church" title="" />
</div>

<p>Time does not permit us to go on to Gravesend, which like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
this place was one of Dickens's favourite spots ("We come,
you see" [says Mr. Peggotty, speaking of himself and Ham
to David Copperfield, when they visited him at Salem House],
"the wind and tide making in our favor, in one of our
Yarmouth lugs to Gravesen'"), so we defer our visit to that
popular resort until another occasion.</p>

<p>We notice in places where the harvest has been cleared
(which, alas! owing to excess of wet and absence of sun, has
not been an abundant one), preparations for cultivation next
year, exhibiting that peculiar effect from ploughing which
that gifted writer and born naturalist, the late Richard Jeffreys,
described in his book <i>Wild Life in a Southern County</i>, with
that love for common things which was so characteristic of
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The ploughmen usually take special care with their work
near public roads, so that the furrows end on to the base of
the highway shall be mathematically straight. They often
succeed so well that the furrows look as if traced with a ruler,
and exhibit curious effects of vanishing perspective. Along
the furrow, just as it is turned, there runs a shimmering light
as the eye traces it up. The ploughshare, heavy and drawn
with great force, smooths the earth as it cleaves it, giving it
for a time a 'face,' as it were, the moisture on which reflects
the light. If you watch the farmers driving to market, you
will see that they glance up the furrows to note the workmanship
and look for game; you may tell from a distance if
they espy a hare, by the check of the rein and the extended
hand pointing."</p>

<p>Our destination is now Higham&mdash;"Higham by Rochester,
Kent,"&mdash;Dickens's nearest village, in which, from his first
coming to Gad's Hill, he took the deepest interest, and after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
a further long tramp of nearly four miles steadily maintained,
we reach Lower Higham towards dusk; and in a lane we
ask an old labourer (who looks as though he would be all
the better for "Three Acres and a Cow") if we are on the
right road to Higham Station. Curtly but civilly the man
answers, "Keep straight on," when an incident occurs
which brightens up matters considerably. The questioner
says to the labourer, "Do you remember the late Charles
Dickens?" (We always spoke, when in the district, of "the
<i>late</i> Charles Dickens," to distinguish him from his eldest son,
who lived at Gad's Hill for some years after his father's death.
Frequently the great novelist was spoken of by residents as
"old Mr. Dickens!")</p>

<p>"Do I remember Muster Dickens?" responds the venerable
rustic, and his eyes sparkle, and his face beams with such
animation that he becomes a different being. "Of course I
do; he used to have games&mdash;running, jumping, and such-like&mdash;for
us working people, and I've often won a prize. He
used to come among us and give us refreshments, and make
himself very pleasant."</p>

<p>"How long have you lived in this parish?" says the
questioner.</p>

<p>"Sixty-seven year," is the answer.</p>

<p>Time prevents further inquiries, so we bid our friend
"good-evening."</p>

<p>In referring to the sports at Gad's Hill, Mr. Langton has
recorded how a friend sent him a broadside of a portion of
one day's amusements, which from its amateurish appearance
was probably printed by Dickens's sons at the private printing-press
before alluded to. The occasion was the 26th December,
1866, and the Christmas sports were held in a field at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
the back of Gad's Hill Place. Mr. Trood, a former landlord
of the "Sir John Falstaff" (whose name has been previously
mentioned), had, by permission of Charles Dickens, a booth
erected for the refreshment of persons contesting. The attendance
was between two and three thousand, and there was not
a single case of misconduct or damage. Mr. A. H. Layard,
M.P. (afterwards Sir Austin Layard), was present, and took
great interest in the proceedings, Dickens having appointed
him "chief commissioner of the domestic police." Sir Austin
Layard said of the sports, "Dickens seemed to have bound
every creature present upon what honour the creature had
to keep order. What was the special means used, or the art
employed, it might have been difficult to say, but that was
the result." We made every effort to obtain one of the bills
of these sports, but without success, and therefore take the
liberty of quoting from Mr. Langton's copy:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>In a letter written to Mr. Forster next day, Dickens said,
"The road between this and Chatham was like a fair all day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
and surely it is a fine thing to get such perfect behaviour out
of a reckless sea-port town."</p>

<p>We presently meet with another representative of the class
of village labourer at Upper Higham, a cheery old man,
although, as is sadly too often the case in his class, he was
suffering from "the Rheumatiz." "Those are nice chrysanthemums
in your garden," we observe. "Yes, they are, sir," he
replies; "but if they had been better attended to when they
was young, they'd have been nicer." "Well, I suppose both
of us would," is the rejoinder. We are in touch on the
instant. Our new acquaintance laughs, and so a question
or two is put to him, and the following is the substance
of his answers, rendered <i>&agrave; la</i> Jingle but very feelingly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Dickens was a nice sort of man&mdash;very much liked&mdash;missed
a great deal when he died&mdash;poor people and the like
felt the miss of him. He was a man as shifted a good deal
of money in the place. You see, he had a lot of friends&mdash;kept
a good many horses,&mdash;and then there was the men to attend
to 'em, and the corn-chandler, the blacksmith, the wheelwright,
and others to be paid&mdash;the poor&mdash;and such-like&mdash;felt the
miss of him when he died."</p>

<p>"How long have you lived here?"</p>

<p>"Well, I come in '45, eleven years before Mr. Dickens."</p>

<p>"And I suppose you are over sixty."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I shall never see seventy again."</p>

<p>Wishing our friend "good-night," we continue our tramp.
On another occasion we met, in the same place, a third specimen
of village labourer, "a mender of roads," who knew Charles
Dickens, and so we walked and chatted pleasantly with him
for some distance. Said our informant, "You see, Mr.
Dickens was a very liberal man; he held his head high up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
when he walked, and went at great strides." The "mender of
roads" was some years ago a candidate for a vacant place as
under-gardener at Gad's Hill, but the situation was filled up
just an hour before he applied for it. He said Mr. Dickens
gave him half-a-crown, and afterwards always recognized him
when he met him with a pleasant nod, or cheerfully "passed
the time of day." We heard in many places that Dickens
was "always kindly" in this way to his own domestics, and
to the villagers in a like station of life to our intelligent friend
"the mender of roads." A fourth villager, a groom, who had
been in his present situation for twenty years, said:&mdash;"Both
the old gentleman and young Mr. Charles were very much
liked in Higham. There wasn't a single person in the place,
I believe, but what had a good word for them."</p>

<p>It may be interesting to mention that Higham&mdash;the old
name of which was Lillechurch&mdash;is an extensive parish
divided into several hamlets. In a useful little book published
in 1882, called <i>A Handbook of Higham</i>, the Rev. C. H.
Fielding, M.A., the author, says:&mdash;"There are few parishes
more interesting than Higham, as it provides food for the
antiquarian and the student of Nature; while its position
near the 'Medway smooth, and the Royal-masted Thame,'
affords to the artist many an opportunity for a picture,
while the idler has the privilege of lovely views." Mr. Roach
Smith was of opinion that Higham was the seat of "a great
Roman pottery." A Monastery of importance existed here
for several centuries, Mary, daughter of King Stephen, being
one of the Prioresses; but it was dissolved by Henry VIII.
The list of flowering plants given in Mr. Fielding's book is
extensive and interesting, and contains many rarities.</p>

<p>A "Cheap Jack," a veritable Doctor Marigold, had taken up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
his quarters at Higham, and we loiter among the bystanders
to hear his patter. We feel quite sure that had Dickens been
present he would have listened and been as amused with
him as ourselves. We heard a few days previously the
public crier going round in his cart, announcing the arrival
of this worthy by ringing his bell and proclaiming in a
stentorian voice something to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The public is respectfully informed that the Cheap Jack
has arrived, bringing with him a large assortment of London,
Birmingham, and Sheffield goods, together with a choice
collection of glass and earthenware, which he will sell every
evening at the most reasonable prices."</p>

<p>On our arrival here we find him on his rostrum surrounded
by some flaring naphtha lamps, and thus disposing of some
penny books of songs: "Now, ladies and gentlemen, what
shall we have the pleasure of saying for this handsome book,
containing over a hundred songs sung by all the great singers
of the day&mdash;Macdermott, Madam Langtry, Sims Reeves, and
other eminent vocalists&mdash;besides numerous toasts and readings.
Well, I won't ask sixpence, and I won't take fivepence,
fourpence, threepence, twopence&mdash;no, I only ask a penny.
Sold again, and got the money. Take care of the ha'pence"
(to his assistant), "for we gives them to the blind when they
can see to pick 'em up." We of course bought a copy of the
famous collection as a "Dickens-item."</p>

<p>Before returning to Rochester we are anxious to identify
the blacksmith's shop where the <i>feu de joie</i> was fired from
"two smuggled cannons," in honour of the marriage of Miss
Kate Dickens to Mr. Charles Collins. Alterations have taken
place which render identification impossible; but a local
blacksmith, who has established himself here, gives us some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
interesting particulars of the games in which he took part.
He mentions also a circumstance relating to Dickens's favourite
horse, Toby. It appears that it was an express wish of
the novelist that when he died this horse should be shot;
and according to our informant the horse was shod on the
Tuesday before the 9th of June (the day of Dickens's death),
and shot on the following Monday. The gun was loaded
with small shot, and poor Toby died immediately it was fired.
The blacksmith thoroughly confirms the opinion of the old
labourers as to the kindness of Charles Dickens to his poorer
neighbours. A curious episode occurs in our conference
with this man: he seems under the impression, which no
amount of assertion on our part can overcome, that my
friend and fellow tramp, Mr. Kitton, is Mr. Henry Fielding
Dickens. Whether there was any facial resemblance or likeness
of manner did not transpire, but again and again he
kept saying, "Now ain't you Harry Dickens?" Among the
names at Higham we notice that of a well-remembered
Dickens character&mdash;Mr. Stiggins!</p>

<p>On arriving at Higham Railway Station, we chat a bit
with the station-master and porter there, but both are
comparatively fresh comers and knew not Charles Dickens.
After an enjoyable but somewhat fatiguing tramp, we are
glad to take a late evening train from Higham to Strood,
and thus ends our inspection of the land of "the Meshes."</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>By the kindness of Mr. Henry Smetham (locally famed as
the "Laureate of Strood"), we subsequently had an introduction
to Mrs. Taylor, formerly school-mistress at Higham,
who came there in 1860, and remained until some years after
the death of Charles Dickens. She knew the novelist well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
and used to see him almost every day when he was at home.
She said, "If I had met him and did not know who he was,
I should have set him down as a good-hearted English
gentleman." He was very popular and much liked in the
neighbourhood. On his return from America, in the first
week of May, 1868, garlands of flowers were put by the
villagers across the road from the railway station to Gad's
Hill. There was a flag at Gad's (a Union Jack, she thinks),
which was always hoisted when Dickens was at home.
He never read at Higham, and never came to the school;
but he always allowed the use of the meadow at the
back of Gad's Hill Place for the school treats, either of
church or chapel, and contributed to such treats sweets
and what not.</p>

<p>Mrs. Taylor remembers that the carriage was sent down
from Gad's Hill Place to the Higham railway station nearly
every night at ten o'clock to meet either Charles Dickens or
his friends. It passed the school, and she well recollects the
pleasant sound made by the bells. She heard Dickens read
<i>Sairey Gamp</i> in London once, and did not like the dress he
wore, but thought the reading very wonderful.</p>

<p>This lady says she was in London at the time of the death
of Charles Dickens, the announcement of which she saw on a
newspaper placard, and was ill the whole of the day afterwards.
It was a sorrowful day for her.</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>We are much indebted to Mrs. Budden of Gad's Hill Place
for the following interesting particulars which she obtained
from Mrs. Easedown, of Higham, "who was parlour-maid
to Mr. Dickens, and left to be married on the 8th of June,
the day he was seized with the fit. She says it was her duty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
to hoist the flag on the top of the house directly Mr. Dickens
arrived at Gad's Hill. It was a small flag, not more than
fourteen inches square, and was kept in the billiard-room.
She says he was the dearest and best gentleman that ever
lived, and the kindest of masters. He asked her to stay and
wait at table the night he was taken ill; she said if he wished
it she would, and then he said, 'Never mind; I don't feel
well.' She saw him after he was dead, laid out in the dining-room,
when his coffin was covered with scarlet geraniums&mdash;his
favourite flower. The flower-beds on the lawns at Gad's
Hill in his time were always filled with scarlet geraniums;
they have since been done away with. Over the head
of the coffin was the oil painting of himself as a young
man (probably Maclise's portrait)&mdash;on one side a picture
of 'Dolly Varden,' and on the other 'Kate Nickleby.'
He gave Mrs. Easedown, on the day she left his service,
a photograph of himself with his name written on the
back. Each of the other servants at Gad's Hill Place was
presented with a similar photograph. She said he was unusually
busy at the time of his death, as on the Monday
morning he ordered breakfast to be ready during the week
at 7.30 ('Sharp, mind') instead of his usual time, 9 o'clock, as
he said 'he had so much to do before Friday.' But&mdash;'Such
a thing was never to be,' for on the Thursday he
breathed his last!"</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>Mrs. Wright, the wife of Mr. Henry Wright, surveyor of
Higham, lived four years at Gad's Hill Place as parlour-maid.
She is the proud possessor of some interesting relics of her
late master. These include his soup-plate, a meerschaum
pipe (presented to him, but he chiefly smoked cigars&mdash;he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
not a great smoker), a wool-worked kettle-holder (which he
constantly used), and a pair of small bellows. When she was
married Mr. Dickens presented her with a China tea service,
"not a single piece of which," said Mrs. Wright proudly, "has
been broken."</p>

<p>She remembers, at the time of her engagement as parlour-maid,
that the servants told her to let a gentleman in at the
front door who was approaching. She didn't know who it
was, as she had never seen Mr. Dickens before. She opened
the door, and the gentleman entered in a very upright
manner, and after thanking her, looked hard at her, and then
walked up-stairs. On returning to the kitchen the servants
asked who it was that had just come in. She replied, "I
don't know, but I think it was the master." "Did he speak?"
they asked. "No," said she, "but he looked at me in a very
determined way." Said they, "He was reading your character,
and he now knows you thoroughly," or words to that
effect.</p>

<p>As parlour-maid, it was part of her duty to carve and wait
on her master specially. The dinner serviettes were wrapped
up in a peculiar manner, and Mrs. Wright remembers that
Lord Darnley's servants were always anxious to learn how
the folding was done, but they never discovered the secret.
At dinner-parties, it was the custom to place a little "button-hole"
for each guest. This was mostly made up of scarlet
geranium (Dickens's favourite flower), with a bit of the leaf
and a frond of maidenhair fern. On one occasion in her
early days, the dinner-lift (to the use of which she was unaccustomed)
broke and ran down quickly, smashing the
crockery and bruising her arm. Mr. Dickens jumped up
quickly and said, "Never mind the breakage; is your arm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
hurt?" As it was painful, he immediately applied arnica
to the bruise, and gave her a glass of port wine, "treating
me," Mrs. Wright remarked, "more like a child of his own
than a servant."</p>

<p>When she was married, and left Gad's Hill, she brought her
first child to show her former master. He took notice of it,
and asked her what he could buy as a present. She thanked
him, and said she did not want anything. On leaving he
gently put a sovereign into the baby's little hand, and said,
"Buy something with that."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright spoke of the great interest which Dickens took
in the children's treats at Higham, lending his meadow for
them, providing sweets and cakes for the little ones, and
apples to be scrambled for. He took great delight in seeing
the scrambles.</p>

<p>She also referred to the cricket club, and said that when
the matches were going on it was a regular holiday at
Higham. Dickens used to take the scores, and at the end
of the game he gave prizes and made little speeches. Her
husband, Mr. Henry Wright, acted as secretary to the club,
and is the possessor of a letter written by Mr. Dickens, in
reply to an address which had been presented to him, of
which letter the following is a copy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'>

<p>"I beg you to assure the rest that it will always give me
great pleasure to lend my meadow for any such good purpose,
and that I feel a sincere desire to be a good friend to the
working men in this neighbourhood. I am always interested
in their welfare, and am always heartily glad to see them
enjoying rational and healthful recreation.</p>

<p>"It did not escape my notice that some expressions were

</div>

<p>Both Mrs. Easedown and Mrs. Wright informed us (through
Mrs. Budden) that "Mr. Dickens was the best of masters, and
a dear good man; that he gave a great deal away in the
parish, and was very much missed; that he frequently went
to church and sat in the chancel.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When he lived in
Higham there used to be a great deal of ague, and he gave
away an immense quantity of port wine and quinine. Since
the Cement Works have been at Cliffe there has been very
little ague at Higham."</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>Mr. Robert Lake Cobb, of Mockbeggar House, Higham, a
land agent of high position and a County Councillor, told us
that he took in the <i>Pickwick Papers</i> as they appeared in
numbers, and he recollected how eagerly he read them, and
how tiresome it was to have to wait month by month until
the story was finished. The book made a tremendous sensation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
at the time. Many years afterwards Charles Dickens
came to reside at Gad's Hill Place, and the families became
intimate. "Mr. Dickens," observed our informant, "was a
very pleasant neighbour, and had always got something nice
to say. He was a dreadful man to walk&mdash;very few could
keep up with him."</p>

<p>Mr. Cobb had one son, Herbert, who was a playfellow of
Dickens's boys; and as illustrative of the interest he took in
his neighbours, on one occasion the novelist and our informant
were talking over matters, when the former said, "What are
you going to bring your boy up to?" "A land agent,"
replied Mr. Cobb. "Ah," said the novelist, "whatever you
do, make him self-reliant." He thought that of all the sons
Mr. Henry Fielding Dickens most resembled his father.</p>

<p>Among the notable people Mr. Cobb met at Gad's Hill
Place were Mr. Forster, Mr. Wilkie Collins, Mr. Fechter the
actor, and others. When Hans Christian Andersen was
visiting there, Dickens took him to Higham Church. Mr.
Cobb spoke of the pleasant picnic parties which Dickens gave
on Blue Bell Hill. He was of opinion that Cob-Tree Hall
in that neighbourhood, about one and a half miles from
Aylesford, nearly parallel with the river, suggested the original
of Manor Farm, Dingley Dell. It formerly belonged to Mr.
Franklin, and is now occupied by Major Trousdell. Mr.
Cobb believed that Dickens took the title of <i>No Thoroughfare</i>&mdash;which
he and Wilkie Collins contributed to the 1867
number of <i>All the Year Round</i>, and in the dramatizing of
which Dickens subsequently was so interested&mdash;from the
notice-boards which were put up by Lord Darnley in many
parts of Cobham Park.</p>

<p>On one occasion our informant remembers a stoppage of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
the train in Higham tunnel, which caused some consternation
to the passengers, as no explanation of the delay was
forthcoming from any of the railway officials. The station-master
coming up at the time, Dickens remarked&mdash;"Ah! an
unwilling witness, Mr. Wood."</p>

<p>Mr. Cobb mentioned that Miss Hogarth, Dickens's sister-in-law,
was a great favourite in the neighbourhood, from her
kindness and thoughtfulness for all with whom she came in
contact, and especially the poor of Higham.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>COBHAM PARK AND HALL, THE LEATHER BOTTLE, SHORNE, CHALK, AND THE DOVER ROAD.</h3>

<div class="hang2">"It's a place you may well be fond of and attached to, for it's the prettiest
spot in all the country round."&mdash;<i>The Village Coquettes.</i></div>

<div class="hang2">"The last soft light of the setting sun had fallen on the earth, casting a
rich glow on the yellow corn sheaves, and lengthening the shadows of
the orchard trees."&mdash;<i>The Pickwick Papers.</i></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">We</span> reserve this, our last long tramp in "Dickens-Land," for
the Friday before our departure. Mrs. Perugini, the novelist's
second daughter, had recently told us that this was the most
beautiful of all the beautiful parts of Kent, and so indeed it
proves to be. Its sylvan scenery is truly unique.</div>

<p>Mr. Charles Dickens the younger, in his valuable annotated
Jubilee edition of <i>Pickwick</i>, has included this note relating to
Cobham:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As all the world knows, the neighbourhood of Rochester
was dear to Charles Dickens. There it is that Gad's Hill
Place stands, the house to which, as 'a queer, small boy,' he
looked forward as the possible reward of an industrious
career, and in which he passed the later years of his life;
and near Rochester, still approached by the 'delightful walk'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
here described, is Cobham, one of the most charming villages
in that part of Kent. Down the lanes, and through the park
to Cobham, was always a favourite walk with Charles Dickens;
and he never wearied of acting as <i>cicerone</i> to his guests to
its fine church and the quaint almshouses with the disused
refectory behind it."</p>

<p>Happily the weather again favours us on this delightful
excursion. It is just such a day as that on which we made
our visit to Gad's Hill. As we have had much tramping
about Rochester during the morning, we prudently take an
early afternoon train to Higham, to save our legs. The
short distance of about four miles consists almost entirely of
tunnels cut through the chalk.</p>

<p>Alighting at Higham Station, we make our way for the
Dover Road and reach Pear Tree Lane, which turns out of it
for Cobham. We notice in passing through Higham by
daylight that the lanes are much closed in by banks, in fact,
the tertiary and chalk systems have been cut through to
form the roads; but here and there one gets glimpses of the
Thames, its course being marked by the white or brown
wings of sailing-boats.</p>

<p>The lane above alluded to, a little above Gad's Hill, is the
direct road to Cobham, and on entering it we are immediately
struck with the different scene presented, as compared with
any part of the county we have previously gone over. It
is cut through the Thanet Sands, which at first are of ashy
gray colour, but after some distance are of a bright red
hue, probably owing to infiltration, and the road rises gently
until the woods are reached. The vegetation growing
on the high banks consists of oak, hazel, beech, sycamore,
and Spanish chestnut, in many places intermingled with wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
clematis. The branches of the trees are not allowed to grow
over into the road, but are kept well cut back so as practically
to form a wall on either side, extending in some places to
twelve feet high. The effect is to present an almost unbroken
surface of various shades of green, deliciously cool and shady
in the heat of summer, and brightened here and there in
autumn by the rich orange-coloured fruit of the arum, the
scarlet berries of the white bryony, and&mdash;deeper in the
woods&mdash;by the pinky-waxen berries of the spindle-tree,
described by Lord Tennyson as "the fruit which in our
winter woodland looks a flower."</p>

<p>As the road continually winds in its upward progress, and
as no part within view extends beyond a few hundred yards
before it turns again, the limit of perspective is frequently
arrested by a number of evergreen arches. It was a Devonshire
lane, so to speak, in a state of cultivation. Of course
in the early spring, the delicacy of the fresh green foliage
would give another picture; and again the autumnal tints
would present a totally different effect under the influence of
the rich colouring of decaying vegetation.</p>

<p>No wonder Dickens and his friends had such admiration
for this walk, the last, by the way, that he ever enjoyed, on
Tuesday, 7th June, 1870, with his sister-in-law, Miss Hogarth,
the day before the fatal seizure. In a letter written from
Lausanne, so far back as the year 1846, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Green woods and green shades about here are more like
Cobham, in Kent, than anything we dream of at the foot of
Alpine passes."</p>

<p>When we reach an elevation and are able to get an extended
view of the country we have traversed, a magnificent
prospect of the Thames valley on the west side, and of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
Medway valley on the east, discloses itself. On a bank in
this lane we find a rather rare plant, the long-stalked crane's-bill
(<i>Geranium columbinum</i>), its rose-pink flowers standing
out like rubies among the green foliage. <i>Pteris aquilina</i>, the
common brake or bracken, is very luxuriant here; but we
have met with few ferns in the part of Kent which we
visited. We were afterwards informed that <i>asplenium</i>, <i>lastrea</i>,
<i>scolopendrium</i>, and others are to be found in the neighbourhood.
We pass at Shorne Ridgway a village inn with a
curious sign, "Ye Olde See Ho Taverne." On inquiry, we
learn that "See Ho" is the sportsman's cry in coursing, when
a hare appears in sight.</p>

<p>The woods surrounding the entrance to the park are
presently reached, and here the vegetation, which in the
lanes had been kept under, is allowed to grow unchecked.
At intervals walks (or "rides," as they are called in some
counties) are cut through the woods, the grass being well
mown underneath, and each of these walks is a shaded grove,
losing itself in the distance. The deep silence of the place
is only broken by the cooing of the wood-pigeon, and the
occasional piercing note of the green woodpecker. It is said
that the nightingales appear here about the 13th of April
and continue singing until June, and that the best time for
seeing this neighbourhood is during the blossoming season in
May.</p>

<p>The temptation to quote Dickens's own description of
Cobham Park from <i>Pickwick</i> cannot be resisted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A delightful walk it was; for it was a pleasant afternoon in June,
and their way lay through a deep and shady wood, cooled by the
light wind which gently rustled the thick foliage, and enlivened by
the songs of the birds that perched upon the boughs. The ivy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
the moss crept in thick clusters over the old trees, and the soft green
turf overspread the ground like a silken mat. They emerged upon
an open park, with an ancient hall, displaying the quaint and
picturesque architecture of Elizabeth's time. Long vistas of stately
oaks and elm trees appeared on every side: large herds of deer were
cropping the fresh grass; and occasionally a startled hare scoured
along the ground with the speed of the shadows thrown by the light
clouds, which swept across a sunny landscape like a passing breath
of summer."</p></div>

<p>Another description of Cobham at another time of the year
is found in the <i>Seven Poor Travellers:</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As for me, I was going to walk, by Cobham Woods, as far upon
my way to London as I fancied.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And now the mists began to
rise in the most beautiful manner, and the sun to shine; and as I went
on through the bracing air, seeing the hoar-frost sparkle everywhere,
I felt as if all Nature shared in the joy of the great Birthday.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. By
Cobham Hall I came to the village, and the churchyard where the
dead had been quietly buried 'in the sure and certain hope' which
Christmastide inspired."</p></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a>
<img src="images/i_404.png" width="600" height="326" alt="Cobham Hall." title="" />
<span class="caption">Cobham Hall.</span>
</div>

<p>We notice in our quiet tramp here a peculiarity in the
foliage of the oaks which is worth recording. It will be
remembered that in the late spring of 1888, anxiety was
expressed by certain newspaper correspondents that the
English oak would suffer extermination in consequence of
caterpillars denuding it of its leaves. But naturalists who had
studied the question knew better. The caterpillar, which is no
doubt the larva of the green Tortrix moth (<i>Tortrix viridana</i>),
spins its cocoon at the end of June or the beginning of July,
and the effect of the heavy rains and warm sunny days since
that time was to encourage the energy of the tree in putting
forth its second growth of leaves. This second growth of
delicate green almost covered the oaks in Cobham Park, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
effectually concealed the devastation of the caterpillars
on the old leaves. The effect was quite spring-like. Truly,
as George Eliot says, "Nature repairs her ravages."</p>


<p>Cobham Park is nearly seven miles round, and its exquisitely
varied scenery of wood and glade is conspicuous at the spot
where the chestnut tree called "The Four Sisters" is placed.
There is a lovely walk from Cobham Hall to Rochester
through the "Long Avenue," so named in contradistinction
to the "Grand Avenue," which opens into Cobham village.
This walk, which slopes all the way down from the Mausoleum,
leads to a seat placed midway in an open spot where charming
views of the Medway valley are obtained. For rich
sylvan scenery in the county of Kent, this is surely unrivalled.</p>

<p>Admission to Cobham Hall, the seat of the Earl of Darnley
(whose ancestors have resided here since the time of King
John), is on Fridays only, and such admission is obtained by
ticket, procurable from Mr. Wildish, bookseller, of Rochester.
A nominal charge is made, the proceeds being devoted
towards maintaining Cobham schools.</p>

<p>The Hall is a red-brick edifice (temp. Elizabeth, 1587),
consisting of two Tudor wings, connected by a central block
designed by Inigo Jones. The most noticeable objects in the
entrance corridor are a fine pair of columns of Cornish
serpentine, nearly ten feet high, tapering from a base some
two feet square. The white veining of the steatite (soapstone)
is in beautiful contrast to the rich red and black colours
of the marble. These columns were purchased at the great
Exhibition of 1851. An enormous bath, hewn out of a solid
block of granite said to have been brought from Egypt, is
also a very noticeable object in this corridor.</p>

<p>The housekeeper&mdash;a chatty, intelligent, and portly personage&mdash;shows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
visitors over the rooms and picture-galleries. There
is a superb collection of pictures by the Old Masters, about
which Dickens had always something facetious to say to his
friends. They illustrate the schools of Venice, Florence,
Rome, Netherlands, Spain, France, and England, and were
formed mainly by purchases from the Orleans Gallery, and
the Vetturi Gallery from Florence, and include Titian's
'Rape of Europa,' Rubens's 'Queen Tomyris dipping Cyrus's
head into blood,' Salvator Rosa's 'Death of Regulus,' Vandyck's
'Duke of Lennox,' Sir Joshua Reynolds's 'The Call of
Samuel,' and others. But the pictures in which we are most
interested are the portraits of literary, scientific, and other
worthies&mdash;an excellent collection, including Shakespeare,
John Locke, Hobbes, Sir Richard Steele, Sir William Temple,
Dean Swift, Dryden, Betterton, Pope, Gay, Thomson, Sir
Hugh Middleton, Martin Luther, and the ill-fated Lord
George Gordon.</p>

<p>There is also an ornithological museum, with some very fine
specimens of the order of grallatores (or waders). In reply
to a letter of inquiry, the Earl of Darnley kindly informs us
that the examples of ostrich (<i>Struthio camelus</i>), cassowary
(<i>Casuarius galeatus</i>), and common emu (<i>Dromaius ater</i>), were
once alive in the menagerie attached to the hall, which was
broken up about fifty years ago.</p>

<p>We are shown the music-room (which, by the bye, his late
majesty King George IV., is said to have remarked was
the finest room in England), a very handsome apartment
facing the west, with a large organ, and capable of containing
several hundred persons. The decorations are very chaste,
being in white and gold; and, as the brilliant sun was setting
in the summer evening, a delicate rose-coloured hue was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
diffused over everything in the room through the medium of
the tinted blinds attached to the windows. It had a most
peculiar and pretty effect, strongly recalling Mrs. Skewton and
her "rose-coloured curtains for doctors."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 335px;">
<img src="images/i_407.png" width="335" height="450" alt="Dickens&#39;s Ch&acirc;let, now in Cobham Park." title="" />
<span class="caption">Dickens&#39;s Ch&acirc;let, now in Cobham Park.</span>
</div>

<p>By the special permission of his lordship, we see the famous
Swiss ch&acirc;let, which is now erected in the terrace flower-garden
at the back of Cobham Hall, having been removed to
its present position some years ago from another part of the
grounds. It stands on an elevated open space surrounded by
beautiful trees&mdash;the rare Salisburia, tulip, cedar, chestnut and
others&mdash;and makes a handsome addition to the garden, irrespective<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
of its historical associations. The ch&acirc;let is of dark
wood varnished, and has in the centre a large carving of
Dickens's crest, which in heraldic terms is described as: "a
lion couchant 'or,' holding in the gamb a cross patonce
'sable.'"</p>

<p>There are two rooms in the ch&acirc;let, each about sixteen feet
square, the one below having four windows and a door, and
the one above (approached in the usual Swiss fashion by an
external staircase), which is much the prettier, having six
windows and a door. There are shutters outside, and the
overhanging roof at first sight gives the building somewhat of
a top-heavy appearance, but this impression wears off after a
time, and it is found to be effective and well-proportioned.
"The five mirrors" which Dickens placed in the ch&acirc;let have
been removed from the upper room, but they are scarcely
necessary, the views of rich and varied foliage and flowers
seen from the open windows, through which the balmy air
passes, forming a series of pictures in the bright sunlight of
the August afternoon delightfully fresh and beautiful. We
sit down quietly for a few minutes and enjoy the privilege;
we ponder on the many happy and industrious hours spent
by its late owner in this now classic building; and we leave
it sadly, with the recollection that here were penned the last
lines which the "vanished hand" was destined to give to the
world.</p>

<p>The Earl of Darnley generously allows his neighbours to
have a key of his park, and Dickens had one of such keys, a
privilege greatly appreciated by him and his friends. Recently
his lordship has erected a staircase round one of the highest
trees in the park, called the "crow's nest," from whence a
very pretty peep at the surrounding country is obtained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>During our visit we venture to ask the portly housekeeper
if she remembers Charles Dickens? The ray of delight that
illumines her good-natured countenance is simply magical.</p>

<p>"Oh," she says, "I liked Mr. Dickens very much. He was
always so full of fun. Oh! oh! oh!" the recollection
of which causes a fit of suppressed laughter, which "communicates
a blancmange-like motion to her fat cheeks," and
she adds: "He used to dine here, and was always very
popular with the family, and in the neighbourhood."</p>

<p>We cannot help thinking that such delightful places as
Cobham Hall were in Dickens's mind when, in <i>Bleak House</i>
(<i>&agrave; propos</i> of Chesney Wold), he makes the volatile Harold
Skimpole say to Sir Leicester Dedlock&mdash;"The owners of such
places are public benefactors. They are good enough to
maintain a number of delightful objects for the admiration
and pleasure of us poor men, and not to reap all the admiration
and pleasure that they yield, is to be ungrateful to our
benefactors."</p>

<p>Leaving the park by a pretty undulating walk, and passing
on our way a large herd of deer, their brown and fawn-coloured
coats contrasting prettily with the green-sward, we
come upon the picturesque village of Cobham, where Mr.
Tupman sought consolation after his little affair with the
amatory spinster aunt. Of course the principal object of
interest is the Leather Bottle, or "Dickens's old Pickwick
Leather Bottle," as the sign of the present landlord now calls
it, wherein Dickens slept a night in 1841, and visited it many
times subsequently. There is a coloured portrait of the
President of the Pickwick Club on the sign, as he appeared
addressing the members. A fire occurred at the Leather
Bottle a few years ago, but it was confined to a back portion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
of the building; unfortunately its restoration and so-called
"improvements" have destroyed many of the picturesque
features which characterized this quiet old inn when Dickens
wrote the famous Papers. Here is his description of it after
Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Snodgrass, and Mr. Winkle had walked
through Cobham Park to seek their lost friend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_410.png" width="500" height="351" alt="The &quot;Leather Bottle&quot; Cobham" title="" />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'If this,' said Mr. Pickwick, looking about him; 'if this were the
place to which all who are troubled with our friend's complaint came,
I fancy their old attachment to this world would very soon return.'</p>

<p>"'I think so too,' said Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>"'And really,' added Mr. Pickwick, after half an hour's walking
had brought them to the village, 'really for a misanthrope's choice,
this is one of the prettiest and most desirable places of residence I
ever met with.'</p>

<p>"In this opinion also, both Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass expressed
their concurrence; and having been directed to the Leather Bottle,
a clean and commodious village ale-house, the three travellers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
entered, and at once inquired for a gentleman of the name of
Tupman.</p>

<p>"'Show the gentlemen into the parlour, Tom,' said the landlady.</p>

<p>"A stout country lad opened a door at the end of the passage, and
the three friends entered a long, low-roofed room, furnished with a
large number of high-backed leather-cushioned chairs, of fantastic
shapes, and embellished with a great variety of old portraits, and
roughly-coloured prints of some antiquity. At the upper end of the
room was a table, with a white cloth upon it, well covered with a
roast fowl, bacon, ale, and etceteras; and at the table sat Mr. Tupman,
looking as unlike a man who had taken his leave of the world, as
possible.</p>

<p>"On the entrance of his friends, that gentleman laid down his
knife and fork, and with a mournful air advanced to meet them.</p>

<p>"'I did not expect to see you here,' he said, as he grasped Mr.
Pickwick's hand. 'It's very kind.'</p>

<p>"'Ah!' said Mr. Pickwick, sitting down, and wiping from his
forehead the perspiration which the walk had engendered. 'Finish
your dinner, and walk out with me. I wish to speak to you
alone.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Tupman did as he was desired; and Mr. Pickwick having
refreshed himself with a copious draught of ale, waited his friend's
leisure. The dinner was quickly despatched, and they walked out
together.</p>

<p>"For half an hour, their forms might have been seen pacing the
churchyard to and fro, while Mr. Pickwick was engaged in combating
his companion's resolution. Any repetition of his arguments would
be useless; for what language could convey to them that energy and
force which their great originator's manner communicated? Whether
Mr. Tupman was already tired of retirement, or whether he was
wholly unable to resist the eloquent appeal which was made to him,
matters not; he did <i>not</i> resist it at last.</p>

<p>"'It mattered little to him,' he said, 'where he dragged out the
miserable remainder of his days: and since his friend laid so much
stress upon his humble companionship, he was willing to share his
adventures.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Pickwick smiled; they shook hands; and walked back to
rejoin their companions."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;">

</div>

<p>In order to preserve the historical associations of the place,
the landlord of the Leather Bottle has added to the art
collection in the fine old parlour (that still contains "the high-backed
leather-cushioned chairs of fantastic shapes") many
portraits of Dickens and illustrations from his works, including
a copy of the life-like coloured Watkins photograph previously
referred to. It has been already suggested that the neighbourhood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
of Kit's Coty House probably gave rise to the
famous arch&aelig;ological episode of the stone with the inscription&mdash;"Bill
Stumps, his mark," in <i>Pickwick</i>, which occurred
near here, rivalling the "A. D. L. L." discovery of the sage
Monkbarns in Scott's <i>Antiquary</i>.</p>

<p>Time presses with us, so, after a refreshing cup of tea, we
just have a hasty glance at the beautiful old church, which
contains some splendid examples of monumental brasses, which
for number and preservation are said to be unique. They
are erected to the memory of John Cobham, Constable of
Rochester, 1354, his ancestors and others.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> There are also
some fine old almshouses which accommodate twenty
pensioners. These almshouses are a survival of the ancient
college. We then take our departure, returning through
Cobham woods.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a>
<img src="images/i_415.png" width="575" height="374" alt="Shorne Church" title="" />
</div>

<p>Turning off at some distance on the left, and passing
through the little village of Shorne, with its pretty churchyard,
a very favourite spot of Charles Dickens, and probably
described by him in <i>Pickwick</i> as "one of the most peaceful
and secluded churchyards in Kent, where wild flowers mingle
with the grass, and the soft landscape around, forms the fairest
spot in the garden of England"&mdash;we make for Chalk church.
It will be remembered, that the first number of <i>Pickwick</i>
appeared on the 31st March, 1836, and on the 2nd of April
following Charles Dickens was married, and came to spend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
his honeymoon at Chalk, and he visited it again in 1837,
when doubtless the descriptions of Cobham and its vicinity
were written. To this neighbourhood, "at all times of his
life, he returned, with a strange recurring fondness."</p>


<p>Mr. Kitton has favoured me with permission to quote the
following extract from his Supplement to <i>Charles Dickens
by Pen and Pencil</i>, being the late Mr. E. Laman Blanchard's
recollections of this pleasant neighbourhood:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the year Charles Dickens came to reside at Gad's Hill,
I took possession of a country house at Rosherville, which I
occupied for some seventeen years. During that period a
favourite morning walk was along the high road, of many
memories, leading from Gravesend to Rochester, and on
repeated occasions I had the good fortune to encounter the
great novelist making one of his pedestrian excursions
towards the Gravesend or Greenhithe railway station, where
he would take the train to travel up to town. Generally, by
a curious coincidence, we passed each other, with an interchange
of salutations, at about the same spot. This was on
the outskirts of the village of Chalk, where a picturesque lane
branched off towards Shorne and Cobham. Here the brisk
walk of Charles Dickens was always slackened, and he never
failed to glance meditatively for a few moments at the
windows of a corner house on the southern side of the road,
advantageously situated for commanding views of the river
and the far-stretching landscape beyond. It was in that
house he had lived immediately after his marriage, and there
many of the earlier chapters of <i>Pickwick</i> were written."</p>

<p>It is a long walk from Cobham to Chalk church,&mdash;the
church, by the bye, being about a mile from the village, as
is usual in many places in Kent,&mdash;and as the shades of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
evening are coming upon us, and as we are desirous of
having a sketch of the curious stone-carved figure over the
entrance porch, we hurry on, and succeed in effecting our
object, though under the difficulty of approaching darkness.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_417.png" width="300" height="356" alt="Curious Old Figure over the Porch, Chalk Church." title="" />
<span class="caption">Curious Old Figure over the Porch, Chalk Church.</span>
</div>

<p>This figure represents an old priest in a stooping position,
with an upturned vessel (probably a jug), about which we
were informed there is probably a legend. Dickens used to
be a great admirer of this quaint carving, and it is said that
whenever he passed it, he always took off his hat to it, or gave
it a friendly nod, as to an old acquaintance. [We regretfully
record the fact that since our visit, both porch and figure
have been demolished.]</p>

<p>Amid the many strange sounds peculiar to summer night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
in the country, a very weird and startling effect is produced
in this lonely spot, in the dusk of the evening, by the shrill
whistle of the common redshank (<i>Totanus calidris</i>), so
called from the colour of its legs, which are of a crimson-red.
This bird, as monotonous in its call-note as the corn-crake,
to which it is closely allied, doubtless has its home
in the marshes hereabout, in which, and in fen countries, it
greatly delights. The peculiar whistle is almost ventriloquial
in its ubiquity, and must be heard to be properly appreciated.</p>

<p>We retrace our steps to the Dover road, and by the light
of a match applied to our pipes, see that our pedometer
marks upwards of fifteen miles for this tramp&mdash;"a rather
busy afternoon," as Mr. Datchery once said.</p>

<p>Since these lines were written, the third volume of the
<i>Autobiography and Reminiscences</i> of W. P. Frith, R.A., has been
published, in which there is a most interesting reminiscence of
Dickens; indeed, there are many scattered throughout the
three volumes, but the one in question refers to "a stroll"
which Dickens took with Mr. Frith and other friends in July
1868. Mr. Cartwright, the celebrated dentist, was one of the
party, and the "stroll" was in reality, as the genial R. A.
describes it, "a fearfully long walk" such as he shall never
forget; nor the night he passed, without once closing his
eyes in sleep, after it. "Dickens," continues Mr. Frith, "was
a great pedestrian. His strolling was at the rate of perhaps
a little under four miles an hour. He was used to the place,&mdash;I
was not, and suffered accordingly."</p>

<p>Having a shrewd suspicion that this referred to one of the
long walks taken in our tramp, the present writer communicated
with Mr. Frith on the subject, and he was favoured
with the following reply:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"The stroll I mentioned in my third volume was through
Lord Darnley's park, but after that I remember nothing. As
the time spent in walking was four hours at least, we must have
covered ground far beyond the length of the park.</p>

<p>"On another occasion,&mdash;Dickens, Miss Hogarth, and I went
to Rochester to see the Castle, and the famous Pickwickian
inn. On another day we went to the Leather Bottle at
Cobham, where Dickens was eloquent on the subject of the
Dadd parricide, showing us the place where the body was
found, with many startling and interesting details of the
discovery."</p>

<p>The subject of the Dadd parricide alluded to by Mr.
Frith was a very horrible case; the son&mdash;an artist&mdash;was
a lunatic, and was subsequently confined in Bethlehem
Hospital, London. There are two curious pictures by him
in the Dyce and Forster collection at South Kensington;
one is inscribed "Sketches to Illustrate the Passions&mdash;Patriotism.
By Richard Dadd, Bethlehem Hospital, London,
May 30, 1857, St. George's-in-the-Fields." It has much minute
writing on it. The other is "Leonidas with the Wood-cutters,"
and illustrates Glover's poem, <i>Leonidas</i>. It is inscribed,
"Rd. Dadd, 1873." He died in Bethlehem Hospital in
1887.</p>

<p>The Dover Road! What a magic influence it has over us,
as we tramp along it in the quiet summer evening, and recall an
incident that happened nearly a hundred years ago, what time
the Dover mail struggled up Shooter's Hill on that memorable
Friday night, and Jerry Cruncher, who had temporarily
suspended his "fishing" operations, and being free from the
annoyances of the "Aggerawayter," caused consternation to
the minds of coachman, guard, and passengers of the said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
mail, by riding abruptly up, <i>&agrave; la</i> highwayman, and demanding
to speak to a passenger named Mr. Jarvis Lorry, then on
his way to Paris,&mdash;as faithfully chronicled in <i>A Tale of Two
Cities</i>. Again, in the early part of the present century, when
a certain friendless but dear and artless boy, named David
Copperfield,&mdash;who having been first robbed by a "long-legged
young man with a very little empty donkey-cart,
which was nothing but a large wooden-tray on wheels," of
"half a guinea and his box," under pretence of "driving him to
the pollis," and subsequently defrauded by an unscrupulous
tailor named one Mr. Dolloby ("Dolloby was the name over
the shop-door at least") of the proper price of "a little weskit,"
for which he, Dolloby, gave poor David only ninepence,&mdash;trudged
along that same Dover road footsore and hungry,
"and got through twenty-three miles on the straight road"
to Rochester and Chatham on a certain Sunday; all of which
is duly recorded in <i>The Personal History of David Copperfield</i>.</p>

<p>In after years, when happier times came to him, David made
many journeys over the Dover road, between Canterbury
and London, on the Canterbury Coach. Respecting the
earliest of these (readers will remember Phiz's illustration,
"My first fall in life"), he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The main object on my mind, I remember, when we got
fairly on the road, was to appear as old as possible to the
coachman, and to speak extremely gruff. The latter point I
achieved at great personal inconvenience; but I stuck to it,
because I felt it was a grown-up sort of thing."</p>

<p>In spite of this assumption, he is impudently chaffed by
"William the coachman" on his "shooting"&mdash;on his "county"
(Suffolk), its "dumplings," and its "Punches," and finally, at
William's suggestion, actually resigns his box-seat in favour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
of his (William's) friend, "the gentleman with a very unpromising
squint and a prominent chin, who had a tall white hat on
with a narrow flat brim, and whose close-fitting drab trousers
seemed to button all the way up outside his legs from his
boots to his hips." In reply to a remark of the coachman
this worthy says:&mdash;"There ain't no sort of 'orse that I 'ain't
bred, and no sort of dorg. 'Orses and dorgs is some men's
fancy. They're wittles and drink to me&mdash;lodging, wife, and
children&mdash;reading, writing, and 'rithmetic&mdash;snuff, tobacker, and
sleep."</p>

<p>"That ain't a sort of man to see sitting behind a coach-box,
is it, though?" says William in David's ear. David construes
this remark into an indication of a wish that "the gentleman"
should have his place, so he blushingly offers to resign it.</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't mind," says William, "I think it would
be more correct."</p>

<p>Poor David, "so very young!" gives up his box-seat, and
thus moralizes on his action:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have always considered this as the first fall I had in life. When
I booked my place at the coach-office, I had had 'Box Seat' written
against the entry, and had given the book-keeper half-a-crown. I was
got up in a special great coat and shawl, expressly to do honour to
that distinguished eminence; had glorified myself upon it a good deal;
and had felt that I was a credit to the coach. And here, in the very
first stage, I was supplanted by a shabby man with a squint, who had
no other merit than smelling like a livery-stables, and being able to
walk across me, more like a fly than a human being, while the horses
were at a canter."</p></div>

<p>Pip, in <i>Great Expectations</i>, also made very many journeys
to and from London, along the Dover road (the London
road it is called in the novel), but the two most notable were,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
firstly, the occasion of his ride outside the coach with the two
convicts as fellow-passengers on the back-seat&mdash;"bringing
with them that curious flavour of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn,
and hearth-stone, which attends the convict presence;"
and secondly, that in which he walked all the way to
London, after the sad interview at Miss Havisham's house,
where he learns that Estella is to become the wife of Bentley
Drummle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"All done, all gone! So much was done and gone, that when I
went out at the gate the light of day seemed of a darker colour than
when I went in. For awhile I hid myself among some lanes and bypaths,
and then started off to walk all the way to London.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It
was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge."</p></div>

<p>One more reference is made to the Dover road in <i>Bleak
House</i>, where that most lovable of the many lovable characters
in Dickens's novels, Esther Summerson, makes her journey,
with her faithful little maid Charley, to Deal, in order to
comfort Richard Carstone:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was a night's journey in those coach times; but we had the
mail to ourselves, and did not find the night very tedious. It passed
with me as I suppose it would with most people under such circumstances.
At one while, my journey looked hopeful, and at another
hopeless. Now, I thought that I should do some good, and now I
wondered how I could ever have supposed so."</p></div>

<p>When speaking of Dickens's characters, some critics have
said that "he never drew a gentleman." One ventures to ask,
Where is there a more chivalrous, honourable, or kind-hearted
gentleman than Mr. John Jarndyce? Sir Leicester Dedlock
in the same novel too, with some few peculiarities, is a
thoroughly high-minded and noble gentleman of the old
school. This by the way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_423.png" width="350" height="239" alt="&quot;There&#39;s Milestones on the Dover Road&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>After walking some distance, we are able to verify one of
those sage experiences of Mr. F.'s aunt:&mdash;"There's milestones
on the Dover road!" for, by the light of another match, the
darkness closing in, and there being no moon, we read
"4 miles to Rochester." However, we tramp merrily on, with
"the town lights right afore us," our minds being full of
pleasant reminiscences of the scenes we have passed through,
and this expedition, like many a weightier matter, "comes to
an end for the time."</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>We had on another occasion the pleasure of a long chat
with Mrs. Latter of Shorne, one of the daughters of Mr. W.
S. Trood, for many years landlord of the Sir John Falstaff.
She said her family came from Somersetshire to reside at
Gad's Mill in the year 1849, and left in 1872. The Falstaff
was then a little homely place, but it has been much altered
since. She knew Charles Dickens very well, and saw him
constantly during his residence at Gad's Hill Place. Mrs.
Latter lost two sisters while she lived at the Falstaff&mdash;one
died at the age of eleven, and the other at nineteen. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
last-mentioned was named Jane, and died in 1862 of brain
fever. Dickens was very kind to the family at the time, took
great interest in the poor girl, and offered help of "anything
that his house could afford." She remembers her mother
asking Dickens if it would be well to have the windows of
the bedroom open. At those times people were fond of
keeping invalids closed up from the air. Dickens said&mdash;"Certainly:
give her plenty of air." He liked fresh air
himself. Mrs. Latter said in proof of this that the curtains
were always blowing about the open windows at Gad's
Hill Place.</p>

<p>When her sister Jane died, the funeral took place at Higham
Church, and was very quiet, there being no show, only a
little black pall trimmed with white placed over the coffin,
which was carried by young men to the grave. Dickens
afterwards commended what had been done, saying: "It
showed good sense," and adding&mdash;"Not like an army of black
beetles."</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in <i>Great Expectations</i> and
elsewhere the ostentation, mummery, and extravagance of
the "undertaking ceremony" are severely criticised. The
same feeling, and a desire for funeral reform, no doubt
prompted Dickens to insert the following clause in his
Will:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I emphatically direct that I be buried in an inexpensive,
unostentatious, and strictly private manner; that no public
announcement be made of the time or place of my burial;
that at the utmost not more than three plain mourning-coaches
be employed; and that those who attend my funeral
wear no scarf, cloak, black bow, long hatband, or other such
revolting absurdity."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Latter then told us the story of the two men with
performing bears:&mdash;</p>

<p>It appears that soon after Dickens came to Gad's Hill a
lot of labourers from Strood&mdash;some thirty or forty in number&mdash;had
been for an outing in breaks to Cobham to a "bean-feast,"
or something of the kind, and some of them had got
"rather fresh." On the return journey they stopped at the
Falstaff, and at the time two men, who were foreigners, were
there with performing bears, a very large one and a smaller
one. The labourers began to lark with the bears, teased
them, and made them savage, "becalled" the two men to
whom they belonged, and a regular row followed. The
owners of the bears became exasperated, and were proceeding
to unmuzzle the animals, when Dickens (hearing the noise)
came out of his gate holding one of his St. Bernard dogs by
a chain. He told Mrs. Latter's father to take the bears up
a back lane, said a few words to the crowd, and remonstrated
with the Strood men on their conduct. The effect was
magical; the whole affair was stilled in a minute or two.</p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>

<p>On a subsequent occasion we called upon the Rev. John
Joseph Marsham of Overblow, near Shorne. This venerable
clergyman, a bachelor, and in his eighty-fifth year, is totally
blind, but in other respects is in the full possession of all
his faculties, and remarked that he was much interested to
hear anybody talk about old friends and times. He was
inducted as Vicar of Shorne in the year 1837, came to live there
in 1845, and resigned his cure in 1888, after completing his
jubilee. He is a "Kentish man," having been born at
Rochester. In our tramp the question of "Kentish man,"
or "man of Kent," often cropped up, and we had an opportunity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
of having the difference explained to us. A "Kentish
man" is one born on the east side of the river Medway, and a
"man of Kent" is one born on the west side.</p>

<p>The position of the residence "Overblow" is delightful.
It stands on a little hill, the front having a fine view of the
Thames valley and the marshes, the side looking on to the
pretty hollow, in the centre of which stands Shorne Church,
and the back being flanked in the distance by the beautiful
Cobham Woods.</p>

<p>The reverend gentleman told us that he was a schoolfellow
of the Right Honourable W. E. Gladstone and Sir Thomas
Gladstone, his brother, at Eton, and had dined with the
former at Hawarden on the occasion of his being thrice
Premier, although he helped to turn his old friend out at
Oxford in 1865, when he was succeeded by the Right
Honourable Gathorne Hardy, now Lord Cranbrook.</p>

<p>Mr. Marsham was a neighbour of Charles Dickens, occasionally
dined with him at Gad's Hill, and also met him at
dinner sometimes at Mr. Hulkes's at the Little Hermitage.
He spoke of him as a nice neighbour and a charming host,
but he rarely talked except to his old friends. He frequently
met Dickens in his walks, and had many a stroll with him,
and always found him very interesting and amusing in his
conversation. Once they were coming down from London
together in a saloon carriage which contained about twelve
or fourteen people. Dickens was sitting quietly in a corner.
It was at the time that one of his serial novels was appearing,
and most of the passengers were reading the current monthly
number. No one noticed Dickens, and when the train
stopped at Strood, he said&mdash;"We did not have much talk."
"No," said Mr. Marsham, "the people were much better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
engaged," at which Dickens laughed. Charles Dickens did
Mr. Marsham the kindness to send him early proofs of his
Christmas stories before they were published.</p>

<p>After Dickens's death (which he heard of in London, and
never felt so grieved in his life) Mr. Charles Dickens the
younger, and Mr. Charles Collins, his brother-in-law, came
to select a piece of ground on the east side of Shorne
churchyard, which was one of Dickens's favourite spots, but
in consequence of the arrangements for the burial in Westminster
Abbey this was of course given up.</p>

<p>Mr. Marsham was staying in London, at Lord Penrhyn's,
at the time of Dickens's death, and Lady Louisa Penrhyn
told him that by accident she was in Westminster Abbey
at about ten o'clock on the morning of 14th June, the day
of the funeral, and noticing some persons standing round an
open grave, her ladyship went to see it, and was greatly
impressed on looking in to read the name of Charles Dickens
on the coffin, on which were numerous wreaths of flowers.</p>

<p>Our venerable friend possesses a souvenir of the novelist
in the two exquisite plaster statuettes, about eighteen inches
high, of "Night" and "Morning," which he purchased at the
Gad's Hill sale.</p>

<p>The reverend gentleman spoke of the great improvements
in travelling as compared with times within his recollection.
He said that before the railways were constructed he went
to London by boat from Gravesend, and the river was so
bad that he had to keep his handkerchief to his nose all the
way to avoid the stench. This was long before the days of
Thames Embankments and other improvements in travelling
by river and road.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>A FINAL TRAMP IN ROCHESTER AND LONDON.</h3>

<div class="hang2">"You have been in every line I have ever read, since I first came here, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
you have been in every prospect I have ever seen since&mdash;on the river,
on the sails of the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light,
in the darkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets."&mdash;<i>Great
Expectations.</i></div>

<div class="hang2">"The magic reel, which, rolling on before, has led the Chronicler thus far,
now slackens in its pace, and stops. It lies before the goal; the
pursuit is at an end.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Good-night, and heaven send our journey
may have a prosperous ending."&mdash;<i>The Old Curiosity Shop.</i></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> is the morning of Saturday, the first of September, 1888,
when our wonderfully pleasant week's tramp in "Dickens-Land"
comes to an end. We have carried out every detail of
our programme, without a single <i>contretemps</i> to mar the enjoyment
of our delightful holiday; we have visited not only
the spots where the childhood and youth of Charles Dickens
were passed, and where the influence of the environment is
specially traceable in the tone of both his earlier and later
writings, but we have gone over and identified (as we proposed
to do) a number of places in which he delighted, and often
described in those writings, peopling them with airy characters
(but to us most real), in whose footsteps we have walked.
We have seen the place where he was born; we have seen
nearly all the houses in which he lived in after life; and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
have been over the charming home occupied by him for fourteen
years, where his last moments passed away under the
affectionate and reverential solicitude of his sons and daughters,
and of Miss Hogarth, his sister-in-law, "the ever-useful, self-denying,
and devoted friend."</div>

<p>And now we linger lovingly about a few of the streets and
places in "the ancient city," and especially in the precincts
of the venerable Cathedral, all sanctified by the memory of
the mighty dead. We fain would prolong our visit, but the
"stern mandate of duty," as Immanuel Kant called it, prevails,
and we bow to the inevitable; or as Mr. Herbert Spencer
better puts it, "our duty is our pleasure, and our greatest
happiness consists in achieving the happiness of others." We
feel our departure to-day the more keenly, as everything
tempts us to stay. Listening for a moment at the open door&mdash;the
beautiful west door&mdash;of the Cathedral, in this glorious
morning in early autumn, we hear the harmonies of the organ
and choir softly wafted to us from within; we feel the
delicious morning air, which comes over the old Castle and
burial-ground from the Kentish hills; we see the bright and
beautiful flowers and foliage of the lovely catalpa tree,
through which the sunlight glints; a solemn calm pervades
the spot as the hum of the city is hushed; and, although
we have read them over and over again, now, for the first
time, do we adequately realize the exquisitely touching lines
on the last page of <i>Edwin Drood</i>, written by the master-hand
that was so soon to be stilled for ever:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 361px;"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a>
<img src="images/i_430.png" width="361" height="600" alt="Doorway Rochester Cathedral" title="" />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A brilliant morning shines on the old City. Its antiquities and
ruins are surpassingly beautiful, with the lusty ivy gleaming in the
sun, and the rich trees waving in the balmy air. Changes of glorious
light from moving boughs, songs of birds, scents from gardens, woods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
and fields&mdash;or, rather, from the one great garden of the whole of the
cultivated island in its yielding time&mdash;penetrate into the Cathedral,
subdue its earthy odour, and preach the Resurrection and the Life.
The cold stone tombs of centuries ago grow warm; and flecks of
brightness dart into the sternest marble corners of the building,
fluttering there like wings."</p></div>

<p>Having time to reflect on our experiences, we are able
to understand how greatly our feelings and ideas have
been influenced for good, both regarding the personality
of the novelist and his writings.</p>

<p>In the course of our rambles we have interviewed many
people in various walks of life who knew Dickens well, and
their interesting replies, mostly given in their own words,
vividly bring before our mental vision the <i>man</i> as he actually
lived and moved among his neighbours, apart from any
glamour with which we, as hero-worshippers, naturally invest
him. We see him in his home, beloved by his family, taking
kindly interest, as a country gentleman, in the poor of the
district, entering into and personally encouraging their sports,
and helping them in their distress. To his dependents and
tradesmen he was kind, just, and honourable; to his friends
genial, hospitable, and true; in himself eager, enthusiastic,
and thorough. No man of his day had more friends, and
he kept them as long as he lived. His favourite motto,
"courage&mdash;persevere," comes before us constantly. All that
we heard on the other side was contained in the expression&mdash;"rather
masterful!" Rather masterful? Of course he
was rather masterful&mdash;otherwise he would never have been
Charles Dickens. What does he say in that unconscious
description of himself, which he puts into the mouth of Boots
at <i>The Holly-Tree Inn</i>, when referring to the father of Master
Harry Walmers, Junior?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He was a gentleman of spirit, and good-looking, and held his
head up when he walked, and had what you may call Fire about him.
He wrote poetry, and he rode, and he ran, and he cricketed, and he
danced, and he acted, and he done it all equally beautiful.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He
was a gentleman that had a will of his own and a eye of his own, and
that would be minded."</p></div>

<p>Perfectly true do we find the summing up of his character,
in his home at Gad's Hill, as given by Professor Minto in the
last edition of the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i> (one of the most
faithful, just, and appreciative articles ever written about
Dickens):&mdash;"Here he worked, and walked, and saw his
friends, and was loved and almost worshipped by his poorer
neighbours, for miles around."</p>

<p>Although tolerably familiar with most of the writings of
Dickens from our youth, and, like many readers, having our
favourites which may have absorbed our attention to the
exclusion of others, we are bound to say that our little visit
to Rochester and its neighbourhood&mdash;our "Dickens-Land"&mdash;rendered
famous all the world over in the novels and minor
works, gives a freshness, a brightness, and a reality to our
conceptions scarcely expected, and never before experienced.
The faithful descriptions of scenery witnessed by us for the
first time in and about the "quaint city" of Rochester, the
delightful neighbourhood of Cobham, the glorious old city of
Canterbury, the dreary marshes and other localities: the more
detailed pictures of particular places, like the Castle, the
Cathedral, its crypt and tower, the Bull Inn, the Vines,
Richard Watts's Charity, and others&mdash;the point of the situation
in many of these cannot be realized without personal
inspection and verification.</p>

<p>And further, as by a sort of reflex action, another feeling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
comes uppermost in our minds, apart from the mere amusement
and enjoyment of Dickens's works: we mean the actual
benefits to humanity which, directly or indirectly, arise out of
his writings; and we endorse the noble lines of dedication
which his friend, Walter Savage Landor, addressed to him in
his <i>Imaginary Conversations of Greeks and Romans</i> (1853):&mdash;</p>

<p>"Friends as we are, have long been, and ever shall be, I
doubt whether I should have prefaced these pages with your
name, were it not to register my judgment that, in breaking
up and cultivating the unreclaimed wastes of Humanity, no
labours have been so strenuous, so continuous, or half so
successful, as yours. While the world admires in you an
unlimited knowledge of mankind, deep thought, vivid imagination,
and bursts of eloquence from unclouded heights, no
less am I delighted when I see you at the school-room you
have liberated from cruelty, and at the cottage you have
purified from disease."</p>

<p>We have before us&mdash;its edges browned by age&mdash;a reprint
of a letter largely circulated at the time, addressed by Dickens
to <i>The Times</i>, dated "Devonshire Terrace, 13th Novr., 1849,"
in which he describes, in graphic and powerful language, the
ribald and disgusting scenes which he witnessed at Horsemonger
Lane Gaol on the occasion of the execution of the
Mannings. The letter is too long to quote in its entirety, but
the following extract will suffice:&mdash;"I have seen habitually
some of the worst sources of general contamination and
corruption in this country, and I think there are not many
phases of London life that could surprise me. I am solemnly
convinced that nothing that ingenuity could devise to be done
in this city in the same compass of time could work such ruin
as one public execution, and I stand astounded and appalled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
by the wickedness it exhibits." The letter contains an urgent
appeal to the then Home Secretary, Sir George Grey, "as a
solemn duty which he owes to society, and a responsibility
which he cannot for ever put away," to originate an
immediate legislative change in this respect. Forster says
in allusion to the above-mentioned letter:&mdash;"There began
an active agitation against public executions, which never
ceased until the salutary change was effected which has
worked so well." Dickens happily lived to see the fruition
of his labours, for the Private Execution Act was passed in
1868, and the last public execution took place at Newgate
on 26th May of that year. As indicative of the new state
of feeling at that time, it may be mentioned that the number
of spectators was not large, and they were observed to
conduct themselves with unusual decorum.</p>

<p>It is valuable to record this as one of many public reforms
which Dickens by his writings and influence certainly helped
to accomplish. In his standard work on <i>Popular Government</i>
(1885), Sir Henry Sumner Maine says:-"Dickens, who spent
his early manhood among the politicians of 1832, trained in
Bentham's school, [Bentham, by the bye, being quoted in
<i>Edwin Drood</i>,] hardly ever wrote a novel without attacking
an abuse. The procedure of the Court of Chancery and of
the Ecclesiastical Courts, the delays of the Public Offices, the
costliness of divorce, the state of the dwellings of the poor,
and the condition of the cheap schools in the North of England,
furnished him with what he seemed to consider, in all sincerity,
the true moral of a series of fictions."</p>

<p>We bid a kindly adieu to the "dear old City" where so
many genial friends have been made, so many happy hours<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
have been passed, so many pleasant memories have been

<div class='unindent'>to take our seats in the train for London, with the intention
of paying a brief visit to South Kensington, where, in the
Forster Collection of the Museum, are treasured the greater
portion of the manuscripts which constitute the principal
works of Charles Dickens. It will be remembered that the
Will of the great novelist contained the following simple but
important clause:&mdash;"I also give to the said John Forster
(whom he previously referred to as 'my dear and trusty
friend') such manuscripts of my published works as may be
in my possession at the time of my decease;" and that Mr.
Forster by his Will bequeathed these priceless treasures to
his wife for her life, in trust to pass over to the Nation at her
decease. Mrs. Forster, who survives her husband, generously
relinquished her life interest, in order to give immediate effect
to his wishes; and thus in 1876, soon after Mr. Forster's
death, they came into the undisturbed possession of the
Nation for ever.</div>

<p>Besides the manuscripts there are numbers of holograph
letters, original sketches (including "The Apotheosis of Grip
the Raven") by D. Maclise, R.A., and other interesting
memorials relating to Charles Dickens. <i>The Handbook to
the Dyce and Forster Collections</i> rightly says that:&mdash;"This
is a gift which will ever have the highest value, and be regarded
with the deepest interest by people of every English-speaking
nation, as long as the English language exists. Not
only our own countrymen, but travellers from every country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
and colony into which Englishmen have spread, may here
examine the original manuscripts of books which have been
more widely read than any other uninspired writings throughout
the world. Thousands, it cannot be doubted, who have
been indebted for many an hour of pleasurable enjoyment
when in health, for many an hour of solace when in weariness
and pain, to these novels, will be glad to look upon them as
each sheet was sent last to the printer, full of innumerable
corrections from the hand of Charles Dickens."</p>

<p>The manuscripts are fifteen in number, bound up into large
quarto volumes, and comprise:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Oliver Twist</i>&mdash;two Volumes, with Preface to the <i>Pickwick
Papers</i>, and matter relating to <i>Master Humphrey's Clock</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Sketches of Young Couples.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>The Lamplighter</i>, a Farce. This MS. is not in the
handwriting of Dickens.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>&mdash;two Volumes, with Letter to
Mr. Forster of 17th January, 1841, and hints for some
chapters.</p>

<p>5. <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>&mdash;two Volumes.</p>

<p>6. <i>American Notes.</i></p>

<p>7. <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>&mdash;two Volumes, with various title-pages,
notes as to the names, &amp;c., and dedication to Miss
Burdett Coutts.</p>

<p>8. <i>The Chimes.</i></p>

<p>9. <i>Dombey and Son</i>&mdash;two Volumes, with title-pages, headings
of chapters, and memoranda.</p>

<p>10. <i>David Copperfield</i>&mdash;two Volumes, with various title-pages,
and memoranda as to names.</p>

<p>11. <i>Bleak House</i>&mdash;two Volumes, with suggestions for title-pages
and other memoranda.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>12. <i>Hard Times</i>&mdash;with memoranda.</p>

<p>13. <i>Little Dorrit</i>&mdash;two Volumes, with memoranda, Dedication
to Clarkson Stanfield, and Preface.</p>

<p>14. <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>&mdash;with Dedication to Lord John
Russell, and Preface.</p>

<p>15. <i>Edwin Drood</i>&mdash;unfinished, with memoranda, and headings
for chapters.</p>

<p>John Forster says:&mdash;"The last page of <i>Edwin Drood</i> was
written in the ch&acirc;let in the afternoon of his last day of
consciousness."</p>

<p>Of the above-mentioned, the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'caligraphy'">calligraphy</ins> of Nos. 1, 2, 3
and 4, is seen at a glance to be larger, bolder, and to have
fewer corrections. In Nos. 5 to 15 it is smaller, and more
confused by numerous alterations. According to Forster&mdash;"His
greater pains and elaboration of writing became first
very obvious in the later parts of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>."</p>

<p>The manuscripts of the earliest works of the Author,
<i>Sketches by Boz</i>, <i>Pickwick</i>, <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, &amp;c., were
evidently not considered at the time worth preserving. The
manuscript of <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, given by Dickens to Mr.
E. S. Dallas&mdash;in grateful acknowledgment of an appreciative
review which (according to an article in <i>Scribner</i>, entitled
"Our Mutual Friend in Manuscript") Mr. Dallas wrote of the
novel for <i>The Times</i>, which largely increased the sale of the
book, and fully established its success,&mdash;is in the library of
Mr. G. W. Childs of Philadelphia; and that of <i>A Christmas
Carol</i>&mdash;given by Dickens to his old friend and school-fellow,
Tom Mitton&mdash;was for sale in Birmingham a few years ago,
and might have been purchased for two hundred and fifty
guineas! It is now owned by Mr. Stuart M. Samuel, and
has since been beautifully reproduced in fac-simile, with an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
Introduction by my friend and fellow-tramp, Mr. F. G. Kitton.
Mr. Wright, of Paris, is the fortunate possessor of <i>The Battle
of Life</i>. The proof-sheets of <i>Great Expectations</i> are in the
Museum at Wisbech. Messrs. Jarvis and Son, of King
William Street, Strand, sold some time since four of the MSS.
of minor articles contributed by Dickens to <i>Household Words</i>
in 1855-6, viz. <i>The Friend of the Lions</i>, <i>Demeanour of Murderers</i>,
<i>That other Public</i>, and <i>Our Commission</i>, for &pound;10 each.</p>

<p>At the sale of the late Mr. Wilkie Collins's manuscripts and
library by Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson, and Hodge, 18th
June, 1890, the manuscript of <i>The Frozen Deep</i>, by Wilkie
Collins and Charles Dickens, 1856 (first performed at
Tavistock House, 6th January, 1857), together with the narrative
written for <i>Temple Bar</i>, 1874, and Prompt Book of the
same play, was sold for &pound;300. A poem written by Charles
Dickens, as a Prologue to the same play, and <i>The Song of
the Wreck</i>, also written by Charles Dickens, were sold for &pound;11
11<i>s.</i> each. <i>The Perils of Certain English Prisoners</i>, a joint
production of Wilkie Collins and Charles Dickens, for the
Christmas number of <i>Household Words</i>, 1857, realized &pound;200;
and the drama of <i>No Thoroughfare</i> (imperfect), also a joint
production, fetched &pound;22.</p>

<p>The manuscripts now belonging to the Nation at South
Kensington are placed in a glazed cabinet, standing in the
middle of the room, on the right of which looks down the
life-like portrait of the great novelist, painted by W. P. Frith,
R.A., in 1859. The manuscript volumes are laid open in an
appropriate manner, so that we have an opportunity of examining
and comparing them with one another, and of
observing how the precious thoughts which flowed from the
fertile brain took shape and became realities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>Where corrections have been made, the original ideas are
so obscured that it is scarcely possible to decipher them.
This is effected, not by the simple method of an obliteration
of the words, as is common with some authors, by means of a
line or two run through them at one stroke of the pen, but
by a series of connected circles, or scroll-work flourishes,
thus, <img src="images/i_439.png" width="100" height="29" alt="flourishes" title="" />
which must have caused greater muscular
labour in execution. Let any one try the two methods for
himself. Dickens was fond of flourishes, as witness his
first published autograph, under the portrait which was issued
with <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> (1839). Some evidence of "writer's
cramp," as it is termed, appears where the C in Charles becomes
almost a G, and where the line-like flourishes to the signature
thirty years later, under the portrait forming the frontispiece
to <i>Edwin Drood</i>, are much shorter and less elaborate. All the
earlier manuscripts are in black ink&mdash;the characteristic <i>blue</i>
ink, which he was so fond of using in later years, not appearing
until <i>Hard Times</i> was written (1854), and this continued
to be (with one exception, <i>Little Dorrit</i>) his favourite writing
medium, for the reason, it is said, that it was fluent to write
with and dried quickly.</p>

<p>From a valuable collection of letters (more than a dozen&mdash;recently
in the possession of Messrs. Noel Conway and Co.,
of Martineau Street, Birmingham, and kindly shown to me by
Mr. Charles Fendelow), written by the novelist between 1832
and 1833 to a friend of his earlier years&mdash;Mr. W. H. Kolle&mdash;and
not hitherto published, it appears that he had not then
acquired that precise habit of inscribing the place, day of the
week, month, and the year which marked his later correspondence
(as has been pointed out by Miss Hogarth and Miss
Dickens in the preface to the <i>Letters of Charles Dickens</i>), very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
few of the letters to Mr. Kolle bearing any record whatever
except the day of the week, occasionally preceded by
Fitzroy Street or Bentinck Street, where he resided at the
time. It would be extremely interesting to ascertain the
reason which subsequently led him to adopt the extraordinarily
precise method which almost invariably marked
his correspondence from the year 1840 until the close of his
life. Possibly arrangements with publishers and others may
have given him the exact habit which afterwards became
automatic.</p>

<p>In addition to the manuscripts in the Forster Collection
in the Museum there are corrected proofs of a portion of the
<i>Pickwick Papers</i>, <i>Dombey and Son</i>, <i>David Copperfield</i>, <i>Bleak
House</i>, and <i>Little Dorrit</i>. Some of the corrections in <i>Dombey
and Son</i> are said to be in the handwriting of Mr. Forster.
All these proofs show marvellous attention to detail&mdash;one of
the most conspicuous of Dickens's characteristics. Nothing
with him was worth doing unless it was done well. As an
illustration of work in this direction, it may be mentioned
that a proof copy of the speech delivered at the meeting
of the Administrative Reform Association at Drury Lane
Theatre on Wednesday, June 27th, 1855, in the possession
of the writer of these lines, has over a hundred corrections
on the nine pages of which it consists, and many of these occur
in punctuation. On careful examination, the alterations show
that the correction in every case is a decided improvement
on the original. The following <i>fac-similes</i> from the <i>Hand-Book</i>
to the <i>Dyce and Forster Collection</i>, and from Forster's
<i>Life</i>, illustrate the earlier, later, and latest handwritings of
Charles Dickens as shown in the MSS. of <i>Oliver Twist</i>, 1837,
<i>Hard Times</i>, 1854, and <i>Edwin Drood</i>, 1870.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>A proof of the fourteenth Chapter of <i>David Copperfield</i>, 1850,
shows that the allusion to "King Charles the First's head"&mdash;about
which Mr. Dick was so much troubled&mdash;was <i>not</i> contained
in the first draft of the story, for the passage originally
had reference to "the date when that bull got into the china
warehouse and did so much mischief." The subsequent reference
to King Charles's head was a happy thought of Dickens,
and furthered Mr. Dick's idea of the mistake "of putting
some of the trouble out of King Charles's head" into his own.</p>

<p>Mr. R. F. Sketchley, the able and courteous custodian of
the collection, allows us to see some of the other rarities in
the museum not displayed in the cabinet&mdash;prefaces, dedications,
and memoranda relating to the novels; letters addressed
by Dickens to Forster, Maclise, and others; rare play-bills;
and the originals of invitations to the public dinner and ball
at New York, which Dickens received on the occasion of his
first visit to America in 1842. After turning these over with
reverential care, we regretfully leave behind us one of the
most interesting and important literary collections ever
presented to the Nation.</p>

<p>We next visit the Prerogative Registry of the United Kingdom
at Somerset House, wherein is filed the original Will
of Charles Dickens. The search for this interesting document
pursued by a stranger under pressure of time, strongly
reminds one of the "Circumlocution Office" so graphically
described in <i>Bleak House</i>. But we are enthusiastic, and at
length obtain a clue to it in a folio volume (Letter D), containing
the names of testators who died in the year 1870,
where the Will is briefly recorded (at number 468) as that
of "Dickens, Charles, otherwise Charles John Huffham,
Esquire." We pay our fees, and take our seats in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
reading-room, when the original is presently placed in our
hands. It is one of a series of three documents fastened
together by a bit of green silk cord, and secured by the seal
of the office, as is customary when there are two or more
papers filed. The first document is the Will itself, dated
12th May, 1869, written throughout by the novelist very
plainly and closely in the characteristic blue ink on a
medium sheet of faint blue quarto letter paper, having the
usual legal folded margin, and exactly covering the four
pages. It is free from corrections, and is signed, "Charles
Dickens," under which is the never-to-be-mistaken flourish.
The testatum is signed by G. Holsworth, 26 Wellington
Street, Strand, and Henry Walker, 26 Wellington Street,
Strand, which points to the fact that the Will was written
and executed at the office of <i>All the Year Round</i>. He appoints
"Georgina Hogarth and John Forster executrix and
executor, and guardians of the persons of my children
during their respective minorities."</p>

<p>The second document is the Oath of John Forster, testifying
that Charles Dickens, otherwise Charles John Huffham
Dickens, is one and the same person. The third document is
a Codicil dated 2nd June, 1870 (only a week before his death),
in which the novelist bequeaths "to my son Charles Dickens,
the younger, all my share and interest in the weekly journal
called <i>All the Year Round</i>." The Codicil is witnessed by the
same persons. The Will and Codicil are both given in extenso
in vol. iii. of Forster's <i>Life</i>&mdash;the gross amount of the real and
personal estate being calculated at &pound;93,000.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<div class='center'><big>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</big></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>
<p>A very short tramp from Somerset House brings us to the
last object of our pilgrimage&mdash;the grave of Charles Dickens
in Westminster Abbey. Surely no admirer of his genius can
omit this final mark of honour to the memory of the mighty
dead. Many years have rolled by since "the good, the
gentle, highly gifted, ever friendly, noble Dickens" passed
away; and we stand by the grave in the calm September
evening, with "jewels cast upon the pavement of the nave
from stained glass by the declining sun," and look down at
the dark flat stone lying at our feet, on which is inscribed "in
plain English letters," the simple record:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<big>CHARLES DICKENS,</big><br />
BORN FEBRUARY THE SEVENTH, 1812.<br />
DIED JUNE THE NINTH, 1870.<br />
</div>

<p>We recall with profoundly sympathetic interest that quietly
impressive ceremony as recorded by Forster in the final pages
of his able biography. "Before mid-day on Tuesday, the 14th
June, 1870, with knowledge of those only who took part in
the burial, all was done. The solemnity had not lost by the
simplicity. Nothing so grand or so touching could have accompanied
it, as the stillness and the silence of the vast Cathedral."
And he further describes the wonderful gathering
subsequently:&mdash;"Then later in the day, and all the following
day, came unbidden mourners in such crowds that the Dean
had to request permission to keep open the grave until
Thursday; but after it was closed they did not cease to
come, and all day long." Dean Stanley wrote:&mdash;"On the
17th there was a constant pressure to the spot, and many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
flowers were strewn upon it by unknown hands, many tears
shed from unknown eyes."</p>

<p>What poet, what philosopher, what monarch even, might
not envy this loving tribute to the influence of the great
writer, to the personal respect for the man, and to the
affection for the friend who, by the sterling nature of his
work for nearly thirty-five years, had the power to create
and sustain such sympathy?</p>

<p>Forster thus admiringly concludes the memoir of his hero:</p>

<p>"The highest associations of both the arts he loved surround
him where he lies. Next to him is Richard Cumberland.
Mrs. Pritchard's monument looks down upon him,
and immediately behind is David Garrick's. Nor is the
actor's delightful art more worthily represented than the
nobler genius of the author. Facing the grave, and on its
left and right, are the monuments of Chaucer, Shakespeare,
and Dryden, the three immortals who did most to create
and settle the language to which Charles Dickens has given
another undying name."</p>

<p>"Of making many books there is no end," said the wise
man of old; and certainly, if we may estimate the popularity
of Charles Dickens by the works of all kinds relating to him,
written since his death, the number may be counted by
hundreds. It may also be said that probably no other
English writer save Shakespeare has been the cause of so
much posthumous literature. The sayings of his characters
permeate our everyday life, and they continue to be as fresh
as when they were first recorded. The original editions of
his writings in some cases realize high prices which are simply
amazing, and&mdash;judging by statistics&mdash;his readers are as
numerous as ever they were. Higher testimony to the worth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
"of the most popular novelist of the century, and one of the
greatest humourists that England has produced," and to
the continued interest which the reading public still evince
in the minutest detail relating to him and to his books, can
scarcely be uttered; but what is better still&mdash;"his sympathies
were generally on the right side;"&mdash;he has left an
example that all may follow;&mdash;he did his utmost to leave the
world a little better than he found it;&mdash;as he said by one
of his characters, "the best of men can do no more"&mdash;and
now he peacefully rests as one</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Of those immortal dead who live again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In minds made better by their presence."</span><br />

<p><span class="smcap">We</span>&mdash;my fellow-tramp and I&mdash;naturally feel a pang of
regret now that our pleasant visit to "Dickens-Land" is
terminated. With a parting grasp of the hand I express to
the companion of my travels a cordial wish that ere long
we may, "<span class="smcap">please God</span>," renew our delightful experience,

to which my friend, as cordially assenting, replies
"<span class="smcap">surely, surely!</span>"</p>

<p>With these two favourite expressions of Charles Dickens
(quoted above) I conclude the book, trusting that it will
prove worthy of some kindly appreciation at the hands of

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In <i>The History of Pickwick</i>, a handsome octavo volume of nearly
400 pages, just published (1891), Mr. Percy Fitzgerald, the author, who
is one of the few surviving friends of Charles Dickens, mentions the
interesting fact that there are 360 characters, 70 episodes, and 22 inns,
described in this wonderful book, written when the author was only
twenty-four.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Forster (I. 14) infers that the family removed to London in 1821,
but Mr. Langton considers (<i>Childhood and Youth of Charles Dickens</i>, 1883,
pp. 62-3), from the fact of the birth of Dickens's brother Alfred having been
registered at Chatham on 3rd April, 1822, and from the further fact of
there being no record of Mr. John Dickens's recall throughout this year to
Somerset House, that the family did not remove to London until the
winter of 1822-3, and I agree with Mr. Langton. Mr. Kitton in <i>Charles
Dickens by Pen and Pencil</i>, 1890, also recognizes this period as the date
of the removal of the Dickens family to London.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Mr. Edward Bulwer Lytton Dickens, a son of the great Novelist, is
a member of the New South Wales Parliament, having been elected in
March 1889. "He stood as a Protectionist for the representation of
Wilcannia, an extensive pastoral district in the western portion of the
colony. His father, it will be remembered, was an ardent Free Trader,
and could not be prevailed upon to enter the British Parliament on any
terms, and occasionally said some severe things of our Legislative
Assembly. His two sons, Alfred Tennyson and Edward Bulwer Lytton,
emigrated to Australia some years ago, and became successful pastoralists."&mdash;<i>Yorkshire
Daily Post</i>, March 1889. A subsequent account states that
Mr. Edward Bulwer Lytton Dickens is about to retire, having been, he
remarks, "out of pocket, out of brains, out of health, and out of temper,
by the pursuit of political glory."&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, March 1891. I am
since informed that Alfred is not a pastoralist, but in business, and that
Edward has not retired up to date.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Mr. Aveling subsequently informed me that the vessel in which the
king took his departure continued to be used in the Royal Navy for
many years as a lighter&mdash;its name being altered to the "Royal Escape."
Afterwards it was used as a watch-vessel in the Coastguard service at
Chatham, and was eventually broken up at Sheerness Dockyard so recently
as 1876.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> "A Perambulation of Kent: Conteining the Description, Hystorie,
and Customes of that Shire. Written in the yeere 1570 by William
Lambarde of Lincoln's Inne Gent."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Mr. Kitton was, by an interesting coincidence, present at the
ceremony above referred to, and he has kindly given his impressions
thereon, which appear at the end of this chapter.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> This was a joint article; the description of the works of the dockyard
being by R. H. Horne, and that of the fortifications and country around
by Charles Dickens.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> It is interesting to record that the foundations of this Church were
met with for the first time, in restoring the west front of the Cathedral,
in 1889.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> This was written in 1888; on a subsequent visit to Rochester we
were sorry to find that the frost had made sad havoc with this beautiful
tree.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Mr. Charles Dickens informs me that Mr. Fildes is right, and that
Edwin Drood was dead. His (Mr. Dickens's) father told him so himself.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Since this was written, Gad's Hill Place has been purchased by the
Hon. F. G. Latham. Major Budden has resigned his commission
locally, and now holds a commission in the Limerick City Artillery
Militia. It is very pleasant to place on record that in subsequent visits
to "Dickens-Land" I was always received with friendly kindness by
Major and Mrs. Budden, whose hospitality I often enjoyed. Their
enthusiasm for the late owner of Gad's Hill Place, and their willingness
to show every part of their beautiful residence to any one specially
interested, was most gratifying to a lover of Dickens. Like the novelist,
Mrs. Budden is fond of private theatricals, and has published a little
book on <i>Mrs. Farley's Wax-Works and How to Use Them</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> It has been suggested that the lines above quoted might give one the
impression that they are those of Falstaff. This, of course, is not the
case. They are spoken by Poins, when in company with Falstaff, Prince
Henry, and others. They occur in Act I. Scene ii. of <i>King Henry IV.</i>,
Part 1.
</p><p>
A Note to Charles Knight's Edition of Shakespeare, contained in the
"Illustrations to Act I." of the same Play, states that Gad's Hill appears
to have been a place notorious for robbers before the time of Shakespeare,
for Stevens discovered an entry of the date of 1558 in the books of the
Stationers' Company, of a ballad entitled, "The Robbery at Gad's Hill."
And the late Sir Henry Ellis, of the British Museum, communicated to
Mr. Boswell, Editor of Malone's Shakespeare, a narrative in the handwriting
of Sir Roger Manwood, Chief Baron of the Exchequer, dated 5th
July, 1590, which shows that Gad's Hill was at that period the resort of a
band of well-mounted robbers of more than usual daring, as appears from
the following extract:&mdash;
</p><p>
"In the course of that Michaelmas term, I being at London, many
robberies were done in the bye-ways at Gad's Hill, on the west part of
Rochester, and at Chatham, down on the east part of Rochester, by
horse thieves, with such fat and lusty horses, as were not like hackney
horses nor far-journeying horses; and one of them sometimes wearing
a vizard grey beard, he was by common report in the country called
'Justice Grey Beard;' and no man durst travel that way without great
company."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> At an interview with Mr. H. F. Dickens some time afterwards, he
told me the story of the origin of <i>The Gad's Hill Gazette</i>. There was a
good deal of sand exposed at the back of the house, and the sons of the
novelist&mdash;who like other boys were full of energy,&mdash;were fond of playing
at "burying" each other. Their father naturally feared that this kind of
play might have some disastrous effects, and develop into burying in
earnest. So he said one day to his sons, "Why not establish a newspaper,
if you want a field for your energies?" <i>The Gad's Hill Gazette</i> was the
result. At first the tiny journal was written on a plain sheet and copies
made; then a Manifold Writer was used; and afterwards came the
Printing Press.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Since our tramp in Dickens-Land, Messrs. Winch and Sons have,
with liberality and good taste, restored the old sign at this historic
hostelry with which the memory of Charles Dickens is associated. It has
been suggested that the sign may possibly have had its origin from the
Battle of Agincourt fought on the day of "Saints Crispin-Crispian," 25th
October, 1415. Victories in more recent times have been thus commemorated
on sign-boards, such as the <i>Vigo</i> expedition, and the fights at
Portobello, Trafalgar, Waterloo, Alma, and elsewhere, and the heroes
who won them thus celebrated.
</p><p>
The sign, which is very well painted, represents the patron saints of the
shoe-making fraternity, the holy brothers, Crispin and Crispian, at work
on their cobbler's bench. The legend runs that it was at Soissons, in the
year 287, while they were so employed "labouring with their hands," that
they were seized by the emissaries of the Emperor Maximinian, and led
away to torture and to death. The sign is understood to have been
faithfully copied from a well-known work preserved to this day, at the
church of St. Pantal&eacute;on at Troyes.&mdash;Abstract of a note in the <i>Rochester
and Chatham Journal</i>, October 5th, 1889.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Enthusiastic admirers of Dickens will doubtless envy me the possession
of some remarkable memorials of the great writer. My friend
Mr. Ball is kind enough to present me with a very curious souvenir of
the novelist: his old garden hat! Mr. Ball's father obtained it from the
gardener at Gad's Hill Place, to whom it had been given after his master's
death. The hat is a "grey-bowler," size 7&frac14;, maker's name "Hillhouse,"
Bond Street, and is the same hat that he is seen to wear in the photograph
of him leaning against the entrance-porch, an engraving of which
appears on page 183. Many hats from Shakespeare and Gesler have
become historical, and there is no reason why Dickens's should not in
the future be an equally interesting personal relic. The gift was accompanied
by a couple of collars belonging to the novelist, with the initials
"C. D." very neatly marked in red cotton. The collar is technically
known as a "Persigny," and its size is 16. Last, not least, a small bottle
of "very rare old Madeira" from Gad's Hill, which calls to mind pleasant
recollections of "the last bottle of the old Madeira," opened by dear old
Sol. Gills in the final chapter of <i>Dombey and Son</i>. Needless to say, the
consumption of the valued contents of Dickens's bottle is reserved for a
very special and appropriate occasion.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> This was written soon after our first visit to Strood at the end of
August, 1888. Within little more than two years afterwards, on Thursday,
7th August, 1890, I had the mournful pleasure of being present at the
funeral of my friend, which took place at Frindsbury Church on that day,
in the presence of the sorrowing relatives and of a large concourse of
admirers, both local and from a distance. There were also present many
representatives of distinguished scientific societies, including Dr. John
Evans, F.R.S., Treasurer of the Royal Society, and President of the
Society of Antiquaries.
</p><p>
The kindness which I received from Mr. Roach Smith, to whom I
presented myself in the first instance as a perfect stranger, and which
was extended during the period of two years that I was privileged to
enjoy his friendship, and at times his hospitality, would be ill requited if I
did not here place on record my humble tribute of appreciation. Born
about the commencement of the present century at Landguard Manor
House, near Shanklin, Isle of Wight, after a somewhat diversified education
and experience, he finally settled in London as a wholesale druggist,
from which business he retired in 1856, and came to live at Temple Place,
Strood. The bent of his mind was, however, distinctly in favour of
arch&aelig;ology, and in this science, which he commenced in the early years
of his business, his work has been enormous. In the matter of the identification
of Roman remains he was <i>facile princeps</i>, and for many years
stood without a rival, his investigations and explorations extending over
England and Europe. His principal works are <i>Collectanea Antiqua</i>,
seven volumes; <i>Illustrations of Roman London;</i> <i>Catalogue of London
Antiquities;</i> <i>Richborough, Reculver, and Lymne</i>, and numberless contributions
scattered over the journal of the Society of Antiquaries, the
<i>Arch&aelig;ologia Cantiana</i>, and other publications. He was an enthusiastic
Shakespearean, the author of the <i>Rural Life of Shakespeare</i>, and of a
little work on <i>The Scarcity of Home-Grown Fruits</i>. He also published
two volumes of <i>Retrospections: Social and Arch&aelig;ological</i>, and was
engaged at his death in completing the third volume. He contributed
many articles to Dr. William Smith's <i>Classical Dictionaries</i>, and other
similar works.
</p><p>
He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries so far back as
1836, and at the time of his death was an Honorary Member or Fellow of
at least thirty learned societies of a kindred nature in Great Britain and
on the continent, and had been honoured by his colleagues and admirers
in having his medal struck on two occasions.
</p><p>
"He was," says one of the highest of living scientists and writers, "one
of the chief representatives of the <i>science</i> of arch&aelig;ology as understood in
its broadest and widest sense. He has never been a mere collector of
remains of ancient art, regarded only as curiosities, but has always had in
view their use as exponents of the great unwritten history&mdash;the history of
the people&mdash;which is not to be obtained from other sources; his writings
have tended to the same end. Hence he stands as one of the foremost
amongst those few of the present day who understand the science in its
best and widest sense, his works being referred to as <i>the</i> authority at
home and abroad."</p>

<p>Speaking with his friend and companion for many years, Mr. George
Payne, F.S.A., Hon. Sec. to the Kent Arch&aelig;ological Society, on my last
visit, about several personal characteristics of our mutual friend, such as
his persistent energy and his indomitable disposition to stoically resist
the infirmities of approaching age, and decline any assistance in helplessness,
and especially as to the <i>qu&aelig;stio vexata</i>, "Bill Stumps, his mark," Mr.
Payne expressed his opinion, that at the bottom of his heart Mr. Roach
Smith may probably have had a feeling that Dickens in some way
(however unintentionally) slighted the science of arch&aelig;ology, which he
(Mr. Roach Smith) had all his life tried to elevate.
</p><p>
A most distinguished antiquarian, a thoroughly honourable man, a
versatile and accomplished gentleman, and a kind-hearted and liberal
friend, the town of Strood, to which he was for so many years endeared,
will long and deservedly mourn his loss.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> It is interesting to place on record here, that the germ of Charles
Dickens's "Readings," which afterwards developed so marvellously both
in England and America, originated in Birmingham. On the 27th
of December, 1853, he read his <i>Christmas Carol</i> in the Town Hall in aid
of the funds of the Institute. On the 29th he read <i>The Cricket on the
Hearth</i>, and on the 30th he repeated the <i>Carol</i> to an audience principally
composed of working men. The success was overwhelming.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Miss Hogarth informs me that her brother-in-law frequently dined
out in the neighbourhood, accompanied by his daughter and herself.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> So far as I am aware, nothing has been done to trace the genealogy of
the Dickens family, and it may therefore be of interest to place on record
the title of, and an extract from, a very scarce and curious thin quarto
volume (pp. 1-28) in my collection. Sir Walter Scott was immensely
proud of his lineage and historical associations, but it would be a
wonderful thing if we could trace the descent of Charles Dickens from
King Edward III.</p>
<p>In the <i>Rambler in Worcestershire</i> (Longmans, 1854), Mr. John Noake,
the author, in alluding to the parish of Churchill, Worcestershire, says:&mdash;"The
Dickens family of Bobbington were lords of this manor from 1432
to 1657, and it is said that from this family Mr. Dickens, the author, is
descended."

present rate of wear and tear, denudation can have lowered the surface
of the Thames Basin by hardly more than an inch since the Norman
Conquest; and nearly a million years must elapse before the whole basin
of the Thames will be worn down to the sea-level"; and Dr. A. Geikie,
after a series of elaborate calculations, has postulated "as probably a fair
average, a valley of 1000 feet deep may be excavated in 1,200,000 years."
Taking these estimates as a basis, and allowing for an average height
of three hundred feet, we roughly arrive at a period of about four hundred
thousand years as the possible length of time which it has taken to form
this beautiful valley. Professor Huxley may well say that "the geologist
has thoughts of time and space to which the ordinary mind is a stranger."</p></div>

executed many years since) gives a good idea of the scenery of this
beautiful district. It also reproduces the profile of a huge chalk cliff
not now visible, but which existed about half a century ago, having a
curious resemblance to the head of a lion, and forming at the time a
conspicuous landmark to travellers.</p></div>
